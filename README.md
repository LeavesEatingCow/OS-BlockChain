# Decentralized Storage: BlockChain 

### Running

To run the software you use the program name in the command line with two arguments which are: the file you want to chain, and its intended directory.

###### ./blockchain <file_name> <output_directory>

There will be a test file provided with its output directory as well, but this will work with any text file and can be outputted to any directory.

By running this executable file you will see that within the output directory you will find blocks with each having a portion of the original file. 

There will also be a manifest file amongst the other files, this file contains a list of all the blocks in order. This file is the file that brings everything into one file when you need to read the file in its totality.
