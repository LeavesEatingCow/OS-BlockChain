Job Offers and Negotiations
If you are offered the job, check your own needs and interests once more before deciding to accept. Although you may be excited and eager to accept a job offer, you may still have some final negotiations.
Before you negotiate. You will want to know something about how much the position typically pays, how much you need to make, and the benefits that are important to you. In addition, know the points you want to emphasize to make your case.

The job offer. When you receive an offer, express your interest in the company and enthusiasm for the job. Obtain information about the company's benefit package and ask for at least 24 hours after receiving the offer to make a decision. You may
explain that your career means a lot to you and you want to be very sure you are making the right decision. After you have reviewed the offer carefully, decide which points you would like to negotiate.

The negotiation. If the offer suits you, your only negotiations may be about when you start. Otherwise, begin by stating your appreciation for the offer and your interest in the position. Then indicate what you were hoping to receive (name your
figure) in salary or whatever you are negotiating. If that isn't possible, you may explore other options, such as such as company assistance with housing or a car, an earlier salary review, a signing bonus, or different options for benefits. Be prepared
to either express regret that you cannot accept the offer or to accept the offer as it stands. Even if your negotiations do not succeed, you have practiced an important skill.

This is an area where new graduates may feel especially unsure. You may want to consult with someone in your CRC for additional assistance or review some resources online. CollegeGrad.com
http://www.coll ad.com/job h/Successful-Job-Offer-N ion/(external link 15) offers a number of guides related to successful job offer negotiations, including ways to evaluate offers and some advice about negotiation techniques.

In some instances, the salary will be fixed, such as in government or public service agencies and organizations. In many cases, there is a range and you are likely to be offered a starting salary at the bottom. It is up to you to work your way up.
Some companies pay a base salary plus commissions or bonuses, depending upon performance.

Too many times people look only at salary dollars and fail to take into account company or organization benefits. Certainly, health benefits are a critical ion given the ever-i ing costs of health and medical care. The "perks" of a job
must also be taken into consideration when judging job compensation. Some examples of other compensation considerations include a company car, fitness center membership, dental plan, flexible vacation times, on site child care services, or
celebration events and special rewards.

A common observation among older adults is that modern day youth want to "start at the top." "They want instant opulence." "They don't want to pay their dues." And, this is true of some. At the same time, most new college graduates are ready
and willing to work hard to succeed.

There is nothing wrong with starting at the bottom of the pay scale, as long as there are opportunities for advancement. Most employers view college degrees as only one indicator that a person knows how to learn and may have enough ambition to
be successful. It is no guarantee of a high salary.

Learning on the job comprises at least 50% of what a person needs to know to be successful. It takes time for most people to learn the territory, work through beginning mistakes, go through some ups and downs, and settle into a comfortable but
productive routine. Once this is most ip want to keep these valued employees and will figure out ways to keep the person employed.

If you don't get a job offer or an acceptable compensation package despite your best efforts, your dedicated preparation is not lost. It can pay off in time. You assess your skills and efforts and decide what you will do differently the next time.

Using your job tools, you start another search. The next interview should be easier, as you will have more experience. The key is to remain positive and not give up. Keep your goals in mind and remember that persistent people achieve their goals
by staying focused on their objective and believing in themselves and the future.
Video-Conference Interviewing

Interviews conducted via video conferences are becoming more common in the workplace. Given budget restraints, more global employee searches, it follows that using modern technology and the Internet is an expedient and practical approach to
interviewing job applicants. It has been found especially helpful in the first round of interviews as a way to get the hiring process started quickly.

Video conferencing can be a very attractive alternative to students at smaller universities and colleges, where recruiters are less likely to visit personally and to rely more on resume information and references provided in a portfolio. For example,
the Career Center at Missouri State University, Springfield, Missouri, has a designated area for video conferencing, and its studio is equipped to help connect students and potential employers.

The following are among some of the tips they provide to make the process a little easier and more effective.

+ View your interview as seriously as a face-to-face interview. Be on time and be prepared.

+ Dark clothing is best suited for a video interview. Avoid fabrics with busy patterns and do not wear solid white or red; these colors do not come across well.

+ Speak clearly and slowly. You do not need to shout. Allow the other party to finish speaking before beginning your response.

+ Small gestures and nervous habits are magnified on camera, so necktie-flipping, hair-smoothing, lip-smacking, paper clip-twisting and pen-jiggling should be kept in check.

+ Although the recruiter is not physically present in the room, assume that he/she can see and hear everything that goes on there. Be careful of off-the-record comments. They might get picked up and broadcast.
+ Be sure the room has ample lighting. Test your video feed before the interview so you can make any adjustments needed.

+ Relax and be yourself.

+ Smile!

+ Avoid shiny, clunky jewelry, which can be distracting.

+ Because transmitting signals can sometimes be delayed, wait a second or two to respond until you are sure the speaker's comments have cleared through the system.

+ Look into the camera while speaking instead of looking into the monitor showing the faces of the long-distance participants.

+ End the interview session by looking directly at the camera and offering a genuine thank you and appreciation for the opportunity to be interviewed and participate in the conference.

Follow-up and Record Keeping

Thank You. After the interview is over, a courteous thank you note to the interviewer or company is a nice and appropriate final touch. Again, you thank the person for taking time to see you and his or her consideration. If you have a sincere
interest in working there, you can add your hope with, "I'm looking forward to hearing from you." Keeping in touch reminds the organization of you and of your interest. The note, of course, contains your phone number and e-mail address to make
it easy for a quick response.

This simple courtesy could give you an edge in job hunting. In some situations, a hand-written note on fine stationery is expected, but that is not always the case anymore. Just make sure you find out the best and preferred way of reaching the
employer, whether by regular mail, email, or fax. An email followed by a hand-written note is often a safe route.

Phone Calls. Follow up with a telephone call to the employer within a week to ask about the position. Continue to build rapport and sell your strengths during the call. In a more aggressive profession, such as sales, you're almost expected to prove
your assertiveness by calling or emailing every few days. Balance the aggressiveness of your follow-up with the field you are in. The challenge is to be both patient (the hiring process may take longer than you expect) and persistent.

Many companies don't tell you their hiring decision (unless you're the one they're hiring), rude though that practice may be. If no one returns your e-mails or voice mails after a few weeks, let it go and move on.

Records. Maintain a careful record of all interviews, contact names, thank-you notes sent, referrals made and follow-up actions. Job seekers who fail to maintain this information often lose valuable contacts as well as credibility with prospective
employers. Furthermore, keeping up on what you are doing can help reduce anxiety and keep you focused.

The organizational system you choose is up to you. Most CRC libraries contain hard copies of d forms and

5S!

to help you organize your search.
Interviews can get personal, so you want to be ready. Questions about family and physical health, for example, can be asked if the employer is concerned about the impact of travel away from home or carrying or moving equipment.

If a question seems too personal or inappropriate, you might ask, "Is this something that's important to your hiring decision?" If the interviewer persists and you don't want to answer, you could say, "I'm sorry but that question makes me
uncomfortable and I'm choosing not to answer it." You could add, if you want to hammer the point home, "You know, by law, I'm not required to answer that kind of question." You politely and courteously refuse to answer.

You don't want to come across as self-righteous or uncooperative and you want to present yourself as honestly and directly as you can. Interviewers who are poorly informed or inexperienced may not be aware of the inappropriateness of some
questions.

A question may be an innocent one and not intended to discriminate. You may be able to respond more diplomatically if you can give the benefit of the doubt in such a situation. If you can tactfully change the subject or steer the question in another
direction, you might be able to avoid a confrontation that could reduce your chances of being employed.

It is really up to you whether or not you want to answer illegal questions. You can reframe them, if you choose, so that they are less offensive. This enables you to keep the interview on track by being positive and redirect the focus to the job
requirements. Let your instincts guide you.

Part Three: About Them. This segment begins when the interviewer seems to have a grasp of how you might fit into the organization and knows more about your abilities, skills, interests and motivation. If the interview is going as you hoped it
would, the conversation can now shift to discussing the company and more specifics about openings available.

This is a time to reflect on what has happened to this point and the information that you want to know about the company. You know that you are going to be asked questions, but it's wise to have your own questions ready to ask, ones that may not
have been answered as part of the give and take process of the interview so far.

What information is still missing that you need or would find helpful in making your own decision? You ask such questions, recognizing that some details of the job might too long to explain at this point given the time limits of the interview. If
your questions can't be d at this point, then you may want to follow up with them later before accepting any offers.

Part Four: Closure. This is the concluding segment. If you remain interested in the job and it seems to be a good match for you, you can express your enthusiasm with such statements as, "I really like what I know about your company and this
job. It's one that I'd like to have." Or, "When you told me about E that was exciting and caught my interest."

You might try to find out where you stand by asking, "How do you think I match up with the job?" Or, you may already have a sense of it and want avoid putting pressure on the interviewer. You could move toward closure by asking, "What other
information do you need from me?" or "When can I expect to hear from you?

When the interviewer stands up, the interview is over. You smile and thank the person for the time and consideration. Then, promptly exit.

The day has come when employers and potential employees are thinking beyond the conventional job interview process. For example, how about Twitter-views? One ad company intended to hire five summer interns based on responses to five
tweets over five days. Those who respond with the best tweets were job finalists. No one asked them for their resumes. For some companies, it doesn't matter what a person is like in an interview setting. "All that matters is their online personality
and being tech savvy," said one telecommuting employer.

Paper resumes may be a thing of the past. The Web has become the new resume and social networks serve as mass references. One manager said, "The best talent isn't looking for a job. But, they are mobile and socially connected. They are too
busy with whatever they are doing to be looking elsewhere, unless they are unhappy and wanting to get away to something else."

Still, there are some jobs where tweets and online interviews won't replace resumes and eye-to-eye interviews. You probably won't see a CEO or a college professor hired based on a tweet or two. As one director of personnel said, "I won't hire
someone based solely on a tweet." But, she laughed, "I would hire someone on Skype."
Here are some sample questions.

What can you tell me about yourself?

Why do you want this job?

Why did you apply here?

What are your career plans?

Where do you see yourself five years from now?

What are some of your strengths that will help you in this job?
What do you need to improve upon?

Why should I hire you?

Some other possible questions can be found in Figure 9.8(external link 14). How would you respond to them? You can think about answers, but it is even better to practice by responding aloud. You can even try one or two in the bathroom alone
after you finish brushing your teeth.

Many people fall short in interviews because their answers focus only on what they want in a job and how they are qualified for it. Certainly, interviewers want to know more about you as a candidate, your background and qualifications, but the
also are thinking about the needs and interests of the organization. How would you fit in? Would you be a good team player? How would co-workers respond to you? Are you the type of person who will be a credit to the company? And, finally, will
you help them accomplish their goals?

Therefore, the more you can provide answers that are tied to a company's mission the more favorable impression you are likely to make. This is one of the reasons you research the company and try to visualize how your interests and needs match.
Relax as best you can. Slow yourself down and take your time while participating in the interview. After a question is asked, rephrase it into a statement and spend a few seconds, formulating an answer. Avoid blurting out answers without thinking
first, which can happen when anxiety is taking over.

Career Coach Rich Alexander spoke about several career issues in a p ion that highlights common interview questions. He discussed five basic principles to consider when answering questions in a job interview: 1) Listen to the question; 2)

Be honest; 3) Be positive; 4) Answer only the question asked; 5) Give a structured answer. The way you answer a question is often as important as the answer itself.

There are quite a few unfair questions that a potential employer cannot require you to answer. According to federal law -- the Fair Employment Practices Act, the American Disabilities Act, and other governmental regulations -- you cannot (should
not) be asked discriminating and illegal questions. They are not permitted because they solicit information that should not play a part in hiring decisions. Of course, that doesn't keep people from asking them, so you have to be wary of illegal
questions.

The following are unacceptable areas for questioning. Some employers may require information that falls within these categories, but it must be related directly to tasks required on the job.

Marital status
Nationality
Race/color

Religion

Sex/Gender
Birthplace

Birth control practices
Disabilities

Names of relatives
The Four Parts of a Job Interview
What do you imagine will happen during the interview? In general, you can plan on being there about 30 minutes - the typical time period. Even though an interview might be shorter or longer in duration, there tends to be four distinct parts that
affect the flow of events.

Part One: Introductions. The first 5 or 10 minutes are usually given to talking casually, which helps people to relax a little, open up lines of communication and establish some connection. Most interviewers like to ease into the heart of the task
and use a little bit of idle chat to reduce tension and create a friendly atmosphere.

When you walk in the room the very first impression you make on the interviewer will influence the rest of the interview. It is important that you introduce yourself, smile, make eye contact and shake hands, all in a friendly manner. The first
question may come to you as the interviewer invites you to sit down. It's probably something light to break the ice or to help put you at ease. It could be something like:

How are you today?
Did you have any trouble finding us?
What do you think of the weather?

Of course, you answer politely without going into too much detail. Rather than worry that time is being wasted in talking about meaningless topics, enjoy the conversation and settle in for the more serious parts of the interview that will follow.
No matter how much you want or need a job, you cannot pretend to be someone you are not. Be honest. It won't help to answer questions the way you think they want you to if it is not part of who you are. Genuineness is a character trait that most
employers appreciate because they assume it is an integral part of being honest and trustworthy.

Your manner of being with people is being noted. Your abilities to establish friendly relationships and to express yourself in an intelligent and organized way are being measured. It starts from the time you first meet and shake hands.

P

Part Two: About You. In the second part of the interview the focus shifts to you. Skilled interviewers subtly move a casual conversation into an exchange of more specific information and levels of communication. This is when the interviewer
asks questions about your background and the things that you do. You are now going beyond the basic information that appeared on your resume or in your portfolio to provide a more complete picture of who you are.

This is the time when you describe in more detail those experiences and skills that make you a good candidate for the job. Most people are hesitant to brag about themselves for fear that it will offend others. You may have been taught to be humble
and avoid boasting about your ability or achievements.

However, this a time when you must stand up and be counted. You don't have to apologize for talking about yourself. In most cases, it is the choice of words used to describe your achievements that determine how comfortable others are when
listening to you.

Have you ever heard begin a with, " I don't want to brag, but..."? Then, of course, they do. How do you feel when someone says, "I'm the best ever when it comes to..." Or, "I just blew them out the water." Or, "I'm unbeatable
when it comes to..." These statements seem to be a little over the top and too casual to be used in a formal interview.

You can give yourself a little wiggle room with such statements as, "One of the things I do best is..." "I was really happy when I was able to..." "One of my strengths might be..." A few simple qualifiers can soften the language but still make it clear
that you excel in some things that are relevant to the job.

You can also frame perceived weaknesses in a positive light. "I like games and enjoy the competition, but when I'm behind or losing I can get very intense and forget that it's just for fun." The interviewer will be interested not only in what you say,
but also in how you say it.

There is no need to be defensive, but you might want to explain how certain things did or did not develop that put you in your current position or led you to make certain choices that affected your career development. Likewise, you don't want to
monopolize the conversation or digress into a long story that prevents the interviewer from asking further questions.

The interviewer leads the way and, given the time limit, you respond with brief replies and examples. However, don't confine yourself to simple yes or no answers. Give brief examples when you can and let the interviewer, if interested, ask more
questions that let you expand and go into more detail.

It can be helpful to think about the possible questions that could be asked and then imagine how you might answer them. You can do a mental rehearsal of the interview. You might take part in mock interviews, where a friend or perhaps someone at
the campus career resource center plays the role of an interviewer and then gives you feedback on your performance.
Interviewing for Jobs
Although a resume and cover letter can attract the attention of a potential employer, it is the job interview that really opens the employment door and gives you a chance to seal a deal. All jobs require an interview, even though the format and
procedures vary from one to another.

The Interview Game

Typically, you meet with a representative of a company and talk privately. This might be a first step in the organization's hiring process and other interviews could follow, provided that both you and the company are still interested. Or, you might
face a panel of interviewers who ask questions. You could be placed in a group and questioned along with other applicants.

As part of a screening process managers at different levels could interview you before a company makes a decision. Job interviews, in one form or another, can take place by phone, on campus, at a placement center or job site, or by video
conference. If you do well and still want to continue, you might be invited for a more in-depth interview.

You have to be prepared for different situations and know how to play the Interview Game. Although there seem to be few rules, there are some customs and guidelines. An awareness of them and preparation before the interview can enhance the
chances of your feeling satisfied with your efforts and being successful.

You can assume that a job interview is a formal meeting, no matter where it takes place - an office, a conference room or a hotel. It's possible to meet in unconventional and informal settings, such as a restaurant or a hotel or airport lobby, but it is to
your advantage to still view the occasion as an official one and act accordingly.

In almost all cases, job interviews are the "make or break" factor in whether one lands a job. This makes it very surprising to find that most job seekers approach interviews with a cavalier attitude and without preparation. They apparently wake up
the morning of the interview, take a few deep breaths, and hope for the best. Unfortunately, walking into an interview cold doesn't work very well.

Interviewers know that human capital is the biggest expense any organization has. When all is said and done, a wrong hiring decision costs a company time and resources. Through a series of well thought out questions, a skillful interviewer will
use the interview process to identify the best candidates for a job.

The Interview Game is a serious one that can be won or lost within seconds. First impressions are lasting. By implementing some simple strategies, you can greatly improve your interview performance. For instance, no interviewer will tell you
what you are expected to wear, but the person will measure your maturity and judgment partially by your app he best ¢ know how to dress the part and are aware of the role they are playing. They have also given some thought to
how the game might play out. They are prepared.

Preparing for a Job Interview
It is important to remember that a job interview is a two-way street. It is a chance for you and the interviewer to get to know each other. It is an opportunity to obtain more information, assess the position and company, and then decide if it is a good
fit. The interview allows you to gain insight into the job and the organization, and it enables the employer to determine if you have the skills and abilities needed to be an effective member of the organization.

With this in mind, the first step is to do some research on the company. It allows you to tailor answers to questions in a way that speaks to company needs and interests. Researching a company and being able to use company names, basic
terminology, and general information tells the interviewer that you care enough about the job to do some homework. You are familiar with the company's mission and goals. In addition, it helps you decide if the job and its conditions match your
expectations.

What do you know about the job and the role it plays in the company? What do you imagine yourself doing in that position? What is the salary range for this type of work? What can you learn from reading current periodicals and trade journals
about the current trends in the organization's field? Who are the firm's competitors and who are the primary customers or clients? What is the basic structure of the company? What are the names of the company's owners, officers, or managers in the
area where you would like to work?

The answer to these and other questions may not be easy to find. This is especially true when a company is small or privately owned. Begin with the Web and then examine company broch
such information is intended to cast a favorable light on the organization. Yet, the more you know about the company, the more competitive edge you will have among applicants.

or public if available. You also know that
Cover Letters
A cover letter accompanies your resume or portfolio. It tells a potential employer that you are available and would like to be consid 1

q
for employ

The cover letter is short and to the point. The one-page letter, limited to three paragraphs, can highlight one or two skills in order to show how you can fill a prospective employer's needs. For example, in her cover letter, one woman pointed out that
her experiences in sales, inventory, and customer service with a wireless services company had provided her with the skills needed to fill a department management position in a large consumer electronics store.

Do your homework before writing the cover letter. It should be addressed to a specific person, whose name is spelled correctly and with the proper title. Appearance can make a difference. Little details count and add up. It is regarded as a sign of
laziness to send out a cover letter that is not tailored to the specific company or potential employer.

The basic principles of letter writing need to be followed, so double-check for any spelling errors or typos. In fact, it would be wise to have someone with fresh eyes to check it over also. In the letter you ask for an interview and appointment,
indicating that you will be happy to meet at a convenient and mutually agreed upon time.

Collegegrad.com http://www.collegegrad.com/(external link 13)

provides a series of brief articles that examine the need for and value of cover letters. A sample letter is provided at the website.

The cover letter introduces your resume so you need not elaborate. However, a few words and phrases can provide the right touch you need. The letter might also draw attention to someone who encouraged you to apply for the position or perhaps
someone in the company whom you talked with earlier. While the letter can express your individuality and style, it should be done within the context of the employment situation.
Education. In this section you will want to include information such as degree, college or university, date of degree, major field of study, minors, and relevant courses. You might list any special certifications or honors you have received.

Work Experience. Here you will list your work and internship experiences, indicating where and when the employment took place. In addition to your job title, add a few words or phrases to highlight work activities, projects and responsibilities.
Key words can make this section more alive and generate the employer's curiosity about your experience. Doing this section well could help you get to the first interview where you could expand on what you have done and accomplished.

Related Experiences. This is where you might list things that you have done or accomplished that are related to the job. For example, if you are applying for a middle school teaching position, the time you volunteered to be a counselor for a few
weeks at a youth camp could be listed. This is also a place to list any leadership activities that you had while attending college.

Skills, Honors and Activities. List any special skills you have developed, such as computer, leadership, tutoring or research. You might include academic, professional or community organizations to which you belong. Listing extra-curricular
activities or hobbies is optional. The key is to include only those items that will encourage the employer to see you as a good candidate. For instance, if you are applying for a job with a sporting goods company, then listing some sports you enjoy
or where you have excelled could be appropriate.

References. This final section is a short list of references. Three will do. Include their titles, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses. You will, of course, need their permission to include them on your resume. Choose people who can speak
about your abilities and character. They might be current or former employers or college professors. Even though they may speak highly of you, omit your grandmother and other family members who are cheering for you.

Electronic Resumes. When submitting a resume on the Internet, you will need to create a resume that it fits the format that online job boards use. Additionally some companies will require you to use a different specific format when applying
through their website.

All of the websites that have job boards provide tips and hints that will help you build a resume that fits the format that they use. You will be coached through the process. If you are limited to one page or must use their particular headings and
sections, you will have to make some choices as to what information you want to include. Some of those sites appear in Figure 9.7(external link 12).

Tf you are constructing an electronic resume, then include key words that a company's computer might use if the resume is scanned. Sprinkle in words, phrases or professional jargon associated with a particular job. The best electronic resumes are
plain, without a lot of special formatting features. Although fancy and attractive on paper, special formatting features could be incompatible with the computer system used by the company to which you are applying and cause scanning errors or
problems.

Resume Resources
If you decide to work with recruiters or an employment agency, then design your resume with them. It is an important first step toward building relationships with these helpers. You follow their leads and learn to do it their way, as they have the
power to introduce you to your next boss.

Portfolios
Portfolios are expanded resumes. A portfolio typically consists of a folder containing the basic resume and representative samples of your work as related to the job objective. The items in the portfolio attempt to highlight some things about you
and open an employer's door.

A portfolio may include photography, paintings, graphic art, models of projects, and journal articles or writing samples. Words and an array of multi-media possibilities, such as sound, websites, PowerPoint presentations, and scrapbooks are all
possibilities. Portfolios are often used, even required in businesses and organizations that rely on creativity.

For instance, in addition to a resume, a marketing specialist could show a potential employer a portfolio with fliers, brochures and ads that were created in previous jobs. For a marketing student with limited experience, the folder might include
copies of term papers, assignments, projects and samples of work completed in an internship.

A portfolio can be a useful tool during a job interview or perhaps when you are attending an association meeting and networking. It might also be used to provide tangible evidence of ideas that you want to develop, such as a projected business
plan or advertising brochure. It can also contain a p g a project that might appeal to an employer.

P 1, sugg

Portfolios have a way of breathing life into the search process. It is much easier for an employer to visualize how your might fit into the company's plans when they can see first hand some of your previous work.
Constructing An Impressive Resume

The first step to creating an impressive resume is to determine what you're trying to accomplish. Recruiters or hiring personnel are busy people who don't want to waste any time trying to figure out what your career goals are. If they aren't sure,
then they will just move on to the next resume.

Your resume needs to motivate the reviewers to want to invite you for an interview. You want the chance to talk with them in person so you can clarify and provide more information, as they ask you questions. If the resume is part of the interview
process, then it needs to draw attention to those things that you want to talk about and use to sell yourself. It's important to be honest and not exaggerate the facts, even though you are eager to be noticed and compete.

The statement that a person's resume gets a 15-second read is not too far from the truth. In fact, 15 seconds may be a generous assumption. In reality, if a resume is one among dozens, it must capture the recruiter's attention in the first five seconds
to avoid being passed over. You can greatly improve your chances by giving attention to your format, using appropriate keywords, and h ghting your rE

Most resumes are one or two pages in length. You can be prepared to provide more history and details in an extended but separate, list, if needed. If you have considerable work experience, special accomplishments, or an unusual but relevant
history that you want the employer to know about, then create a professional vitae and make it available.

Of course, you are free to develop your own resume and to cast it in a way that you think creates your best one-page advertisement. As long as it provides an overview of your education, work experience and related skills, then probably it will be
suitable. It's not meant to tell everything about your studies, work history and the things that you can do. You select and present information that will persuade the employer to include you in a list of viable candidates.

Custom suggests that certain information be included in your resume and there are some standard categories that are usually included. Keep it concise and targeted. Hiring managers often sort through hundreds of resumes to fill one job opening.
Make it easy on them by keeping the items on your resume short and to the point. These factors, custom and brevity, do have a limiting effect on just how creative one can get and still convey the necessary material.

There are for resumes available in career guidebooks, CRCs, and online. You can tailor yours to best match your occupational choice and personal qualifications and preparation. Further, you can tailor a resume to
match an employer's particular needs par interests. The key is to research the hiring companies so that you can adapt your resume toward them. You can find information about an organization through company brochures and materials, the Web,
newspaper articles and perhaps people who work there.

Contact information. At the top of the first page will be the basic data that identifies you: name, title, address, phone number, and e-mail address. Since certain personal information is considered to be irrelevant to your ability to perform a job,
items such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status and country of origin should be excluded.

Objective or Qualifications Summary. These are fast, effective ways to hook the reader into looking at the rest of your resume. Both methods give focus to a resume and quickly orient the employer to your potential value to the company.
A career objective can be a great way to start your resume if you know exactly what you are applying for. If you include an objective, be specific and stay away from vague statements that say nothing substantial about your career goal (e.g.,
"seeking a challenging position with potential for growth and advancement"). A more specific example is, "A position as a Support Specialist allowing me to use my skills in the fields of computer science and management information systems."

If there are several potential positions for which you might qualify, or if you can't be specific about a targeted job, or you are using your resume for a general purpose (e.g., job fairs), then a qualifications summary (or profile) would be better for
you. Spotlighting skills can be quite appealing to employers, and the keywords used in such sections can be an important element of a resume that's electronically scanned.

Recent graduates often have difficulty getting the jobs they want because employers generally hire someone with more experience. In this case, you may want to emphasize your adaptive skills that could overcome a lack of experience. On the
Internet, you can find numerous websites and webpages dedicated to helping job seekers refine their resumes. For example, Career Owl http://www.careerowlresource /Res_Frame.htm(external link 11) presents examples of both career
goals and summary statements.

Your professional resume is one of your most important job hunting tools. It is a written document that lists your educational background, work experience and skills. It is a marketing tool and a brief introduction to who you are. More than
information, a professional looking resume reflects a professional person. A sloppy resume implies a sloppy person.

By itself, your resume is not likely to get you the job that you want, but it can help get your foot in the door. Some employers have many applicants for a job and a stack of resumes to review. What do they look for? How can you construct a resume
that will compete and make you a serious candidate for consideration?

From the perspective of a hiring company or organization, your resume is your initial promotional brochure. It is a brief advertisement that is designed to highlight important areas about you that are related to the job for which you are applying.
Viewing your resume from a marketing perspective can help you stay focused and develop an effective presentation. It cannot "make the sale" any more than an advertising brochure can sell you a car. You still want to ask questions and test-drive
the car, but chances are the brochure has you already moving in the direction of buying it, unless something happens when you see the car to discourage you. It's the same for resumes.
Recruiters. When company management does not want to take the time or energy to advertise and sort through hundreds of job applicants, they hire a recruiting agent or agency. It is this person or agency that organizes and conducts a specific job
search, looking for the few candidates who can eventually be recommended for a final decision by management.

A recruiter can use all the same job hunting tools that you would use. The difference is that while you are looking for a job, they are looking for you. The recruiter is the one who posts announcements, collects and sorts through resumes, conducts
interviews, and eventually narrows the pool of candidates. Typically, recruiters work for large companies or industries that are flooded by applicants or when an executive search is required and only a small pool of people would qualify.

Recruiters typically charge companies the equivalent of 20% -35% of a hire's yearly salary when a position is filled. This may seem like a lot of money, but to some companies it is less expensive to contract with a recruiter than it is to sacrifice the
time, wages, and energy of current employees.

There are two types of executive search firms to know about. First, there are contingency firms used by companies where salaries are less than $100,000. These firms receive payment only if the candidate is hired. Secondly, there are retainer firms,
who hunt for executives when salaries are higher. In most cases, specialized candidates are needed and a company wants to persuade a person to leave an organization and work for them.

One such recruiter said, "Don't take it personally... but of 200 candidates uncovered in an initial search, perhaps 50 will make the first cut, five will be finalists, and one will get the job." However, the recruiter makes money when he finds a person a
job, so it does help to have interviewed with a recruiter or headhunter and be on a list of potential candidates.

Recruiters can be a tremendous resource to your job-search efforts. They are privy to a great number of opportunities in the hidden job market. They are experts at presenting candidates' best selling points. They also act as go-between for a
candidate and employer, allowing the candidate to gain feedback.

As one recruiter who was interviewed explained it: "Let's face it, we're are glorified agents and negotiators. We're in the business of finding bodies with good heads on their shoulders. And, we want the top prizes."
Here are some networking resources you might consider:

+ Alumni from your college or university- Get contact information for people in your area of interest from your college career center or alumni office.

+ A professional association for your field- Most cities have chapters of professional groups. Check to see if there is one for your field in your area.

+ People in the field- Are there workshops, seminars, or presentations that match your career interests?

+ Contact organizations where you would love to work- Let them know that, although they may not have a position available at this time, you would like to be considered for future openings. Tell the company why you are interested and what
skills you have to offer.

+ Volunteer- Find an agency or group that needs people with your talents and interests, and get involved. You may meet some people (or people who know people) who can be helpful in your job search.

+ Consider taking a less than perfect job that positions you for a better one- Internal candidates often have an edge.

Most people hear about jobs by word of mouth. It makes sense to let people know that you are job hunting. It may be a relative, friend or a casual acquaintance who provides you with a significant lead to a hidden job opening. Networking is a tool
that can positively affect your job search and every aspect of your life.

Direct Contact. This method is generally known as "cold calling." In today's job market, it is neither as desperate nor as aggressive at it may first seem. In fact, if you want to tap into the hidden job market, it makes sense to give it a try. You begin
by putting together a list of potential comp and busi to contact.

There are many ways to go about this. You might, for example, track down some job leads by finger walking through the Yellow Pages to find the names of companies and firms in your field who are located in the area. After researching these
employers, you can visit them and make inquiries about job opportunities.

One study showed that 24% of those looking for employment found work as a result of making a "cold contact," when no job was posted. Even if no jobs are available at the moment, someone in the company might have a recommendation or
something else for you to consider. Your cold call contact may become part of your networking process. A student who is bold enough to make a cold contact can also impress an employer because it shows positive energy, enthusiasm, and
assertiveness.
Networking

John E. Kobara and Melinda Smith of HelpGuide.org_http://www.helpguide.org/life/job_networking how to_find_job.htm(external link 09), said, "The best way to find job opportunities is not through online job boards, the classifieds, or
employment agencies, but by talking to people around you. Your network of friends, relatives, coll and ac es is a valuable job search resource. Networking may sound intimidating, but it can be rewarding and fun, even if you're shy
or feel like you don't know many people." You likely know more people than you think and can reach out to them.

They also suggested improving ication skills, focusing on relationships, maintaining your network, taking advantage of strong and weak ties. Networking refers to the process of developing and maintaining contacts who can help you in
your search for employment. For example, many job openings are filled before they are advertised, creating what has been called the hidden or invisible job market.

Information about available work is circulated through an employer's network of managers, business associates, friends and acquaintances. Networking is a job hunting tool that helps you tap into this hidden job market. Participating in Information
Interviews is one way college students can add contacts to their job search networks.

According to one study, 64 percent of the almost 7,500 people surveyed said they found their new jobs through networking. Networking is consistently cited as the number one way to find and get jobs.

Networking is the art of building alliances. It's not contacting everyone you know when you are looking for a new job and asking if they know of any job openings. Networks are cultivated and they start long before a job search. Furthermore,
networks are most effective and sustainable when they are mutually beneficial.

A list of different websites with tips and pointers is available. Here are a few examples:
A Good Network is a Circle of Friends by Nick Corcodilos http://www.asktheh /h work] .htm(external link 10)

"Networking" is an unfortunate term because it implies connections but ignores the importance of true relationships. Networking isn't about the quantity of contacts you make; it's about the quality of relationships you enjoy. The problem is that
good networking takes time and it takes a personal investment in the relationship.

Diane Darling is the founder and principal consultant for Effective Networking, Inc. and has authored two books on networking. She says a quick telephone call ("low tech") can sometimes be more efficient and effective than many e-mails ("high
tech"). When the economy took a turn for the worse, people discovered the value of networking. They called people in a panic asking for referrals or job leads. It should be obvious, but you want to build relationships BEFORE you need them.

Networking isn't a process of making cold calls to people you don't know. It's talking to people you do know or asking them to introduce you to others. It does not have to be a calculated and scheming process of meeting and greeting people. It's
much better done on a more informal basis. Consequently, the key is taking enough time to become better acquainted with people.

As you get to know them, you get to know more about what they do and who they know, and they get to know more about you and the skills and experience you have to offer (and vice versa). A favorable impression makes it easier for them to
remember you when an opportunity comes up and makes them more likely to want to be of assistance. Similarly, if you are able to remember people's skills and experiences, you can help recommend an opportunity to them that might be well
suited, which wins you good favor with not only the person you refer, but with a company or manager who will be grateful to you for helping them find a possible good candidate for the position.

You can expand your network by attending various events and taking an interest in who is there. As you get to know new people, even casually, you are building a network.

"Don't rely on the want ads!" said one career coach who helps people find jobs. "The vast number of jobs available at any given time never make it into the want ads. How do you tap that hidden job market? You probably know the answer:
networking!"
Indeed. The website Indeed.com is currently the top job site with millions of job listings from thousands of websites, including company career sites, job boards, newspaper classifieds, associations, and other online sources of job postings.

Users can apply for jobs, research salaries and job trends, set up job alerts, and use Indeed's job search app for mobile job hunting. You can also gain firsthand insight into employment dynamics through an extensive selection of company reviews
completed by employees and job seekers.

While both Careerbuilder.com and Indeed.com allow employers to post open listings directly to the website, Indeed takes this concept one step further by searching the internet for open positions and adding these as links that appear in the exact
same lists as internally listed positions. In 2016, an impressive 58% of U.S. companies’ external hires came from the Indeed platform.

LinkedIn. While it is technically a social media company, LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the internet. Unlike sites like CareerBuilder and Indeed, it incorporates a social media platform that you can use to find the right job
or internship, connect and strengthen professional relationships, and even learn skills to help you succeed in your career.

Similar to Facebook, when you create a LinkedIn account, it prompts you to create a profile page that displays your picture and personal information. But because this is a professional networking site, that personal information is focused on your
work history, education, skills, and recommendations rather than personal opinions, hobbies or interests.

Once you create a profile, you can connect with people you already know in real life, or people you don't know yet but would like to connect with professionally. It uses the same "friending" strategy that Facebook and other social media websites
do, which helps keep all of your contacts and connections easy for you and others to see via your profile. Also similar to Facebook, LinkedIn utilizes similar "wall" and "status update" type features to share updates, information, articles, and
resources.

LinkedIn is popular with employers and recruiters who review the profiles of talented workers who are not necessarily actively seeking new opportunities, as well as candidates seeking employment. You can use it to search jobs, identify contacts at
employers who are advertising positi follow companies of interest, and reach out to hiring managers at companies you dream of working for someday.

Glassdoor. This is another website where you can search and apply for jobs, but Glassdoor.com is most famous for being a platform where current and former employees can anonymously review companies. It also allows users to anonymously
submit and view salaries, interview questions, and more. It is an industry leader on salary information by company and job type, and can be a very valuable resource to "see behind the curtain" regarding insights and opinions on company culture,
leadership, pay, job satisfaction, and upward mobility that most people don't have access to until they are hired and on the "inside".

However, like any user-generated content, you'll want to be careful to remember that they are only one-sided opinions and experiences, and the fact that users can post anonymously means there is no accountability for sharing half-truths or even
flat out lies. The majority of users seem to be genuine, honest, and helpful, but of course there are also people who might be angry or bitter with a company and decide to post a negative review only out of spite. On the other side of the coin, there
have been reports accusing companies of posting their own fake reviews to cast themselves in a more positive light. So, while an extremely valuable resource, Glassdoor is best used as a tool to gather supplemental information that you then
compare with other, more reliable resources about certain jobs and companies to paint a bigger picture.
Using Resources to Find Potential Employers

On-campus

You can begin your search while you're still in college with a visit to your on-campus Career Resource Center or (CRC). Most colleges have a center or office that coordinates workshops, seminars, job fairs, career days and other events that prepare
students for job placement.

It would be a good idea to visit often in your final year of college. You will find job listings, which are continually updated, and you can sign up for on-campus employer interviews. Recruiters have different schedules, but many prefer to visit in the
fall semester. However, some may come later, even at the last moment, if it is a convenient stop for them.

Your internship experiences can be valuable resources, especially if they fit your interests. Your work during your internship counts as job experience, even if you were unpaid. Therefore, you will want to take advantage of all the opportunities to
learn and put theories into practice while you are practicing in the field. In addition, a favorable recommendation from the internship supervisor or coordinator may count more than others.

It's not uncommon for employers to hire their interns, as they have had a chance to see them in action. Your internship could be viewed as an audition. The employer observed how you interacted with others and took note of your character, work
ethic and how you performed as a team member. If there is not a job opening, the internship supervisor could give you the names of other people to contact.

What can you do beyond looking at online directories and job placement resources at your campus career center? Many of the same sources about the world of work that have been presented in this course will also have information about where to
find available jobs. There are some other resources, some of which are obvious.

Internet Job Boards

di li

The Internet offers i access to d sources for job descriptions, company information, and opportunities for matching potential employees with employers. It has emerged as the most valuable job search tool because it enables
people to work together over time and space. It is job hunting at a distance, but can still be very personal.

It has been estimated that there are more than 100,000 electronic job boards worldwide, where you can read about job openings and post your resume. You have already visited some websites that provide such information and services. New
technology has made such websites even more efficient and useful.

One trend is toward more interaction among job seekers and potential employers. There have been some interesting efforts being made in the area of video streaming and real-time interviews, but it is still a costly process under development.
Another trend is to offer websites that specialize by profession and by categories of job seekers. It is an attractive tool because it can be less expensive for employers who cannot send representatives to all college career days and fairs.
Too often job seekers conclude that the fault lies in them - in their qualifications, work history, or resume - when the real error lies in their conception of how the job market works.

hliched

There is a huge desire to have the Internet job sites be a place for "one-stop-shopping." The following well companies make up many of the most popular websites for finding job openings:

CareerBuilder. Over the past 20+ years, CareerBuilder.com has helped millions of people find jobs and has equipped hundreds of th ds of employers with the talent they need. It is one of the largest job boards, providing job listings, resume
posting, career advice and resources to job seekers.

It secures job listings directly from employers and has expanded local listings by partnering with many newspapers to incorporate their online classifieds.

Careerbuilder integrates useful information about scores of career paths and valuable advice about career development and job searching. The site uses the latest AI technology to connect workers with opportunities.
Basic Steps In The Job Hunting Process

There are some basic steps for job hunting that are useful to keep in mind. As is the case with most activities that involve steps, these steps should not be viewed as strictly sequential. Sometimes you will be engaged in more than one step at a time,
and at other times you may need to go back and repeat one or more steps as you gain new information and experience.

The process begins during college. Almost all career experts suggest that you begin with a self-assessment, taking note of your personality, aptitude, interests, values and skills. It's also time to do some career exploration by researching work
environments and how you match up with those environments. These activities help you to become more aware of the job market and make decisions about your academic preparation, including the selection of a college major and the courses you
must take.

In this course you've had the opportunity to begin developing your career profile. You have been recording some useful information gained through self assessments and personal reflection as well as through research and exploration about majors
and careers. As you develop and study your profile you can get some hints about your emerging career path and the direction you are headed.

Beyond academic preparation, your extra curricular activities, clubs, leadership activities, sports, class projects and work experiences, including internships and volunteering, are a part of your preparation. Being aware of the job search process
enables you to organize information about yourself so that you can make informed decisions.

The next steps involve finding out about potential employers and where the jobs are, getting your job search materials and skills ready, and implementing your job search campaign. Your initial job search concludes with managing job offers and
agreements.

The basic steps of the job hunting process are outlined in Figure 9.5(external link 08).
Job Satisfiers. Earlier you learned about self: and were ged to examine your values and how they relate to jobs and careers. As you begin to look for potential employment options and specific jobs, take another look at what
kinds of things you are looking for in a job. What are the job satisfiers that you most value and believe will best suit you?

Some typical job satisfiers can involve these issues:

+ Working with people or working independently

Receiving close or distant supervision

Gaining prestige and being in the spot light or appreciation without being spotlighted
Structured /consistent work tasks or flexible and changing ones

Security with less chance of monetary gains or high risk with more opportunity for gains
Opportunities for advancement or less pressure about climbing the career ladder
Working with data, people, things or ideas

Hands on activities or more theoretical and conceptual ones

Close to work setting for less pay or higher pay but farther away

Shorter working hours for less pay or longer working hours for more pay

Employment is a two-way street, with both employers and employees trying to meet each other's needs and interests. Use the checklist provided in Figure 9.4(external link 07) to review what motivates you and what you are looking for most in a
job

job.
Job Characteristics. A lot of job hunters fail to ask themselves the right questions before they launch their job search. In topic 7, you were encouraged to explore 3 jobs of interest to you in terms of what those jobs had to offer and how well they
match your interests and needs. Here are some questions that you will want to consider, as you sharpen your focus and choices.

What are the typical job tasks, duties and responsibilities in this job?

What is a typical work schedule like?

What minimum qualifications are needed to get into the job?

What can I learn on the job and are there training seminars that will get me ready?

What is the employment outlook in this field?

What is the average salary for someone entering this field?

What are the professional organizations and associations for this field?

What is the work environment like and how much traveling is involved?

Where is the work to be done and is relocation to another geographical location required or available?
Who are the typical employers in this field?

You may have even more questions on your own list, but as you move into an earnest search, these will help you narrow your options and keep your eyes on the prize.
What Are Employers Looking For?
Employers value experience because of the costs associated with training and the productivity levels of experienced employees versus those with no experience. Experience is used as a general indicator of one's ability. The employee has a track
record and the learning curve in a new job is not as steep.

However, recent college graduates who do not have actual work experience in a particular job can still show that they have the kind of experience that employers are looking for. One way they can do this is by taking an interim low paying job that
requires the use of skills that are transferable to the job the employer has in mind. Experience is sometimes more valuable than credentials. Such opportunities as internships, volunteer positions, student activities and leadership roles, and temporary
or part-time work can also provide some related experience.

When an employer posts an advertisement saying a certain amount of experience is necessary, what they are really saying is 1) they want to be sure that applicants know what they are doing, 2) they don't want to spend a lot of money on training,
and 3) they want people who have made "beginner's mistakes" elsewhere. Therefore, if you lack job experience, these concerns must be addressed in some manner.

The bottom line is that the employers want people who have the ability and skills to do the job. Experience just happens to be a good indicator of ability. Beyond that, it up to you to present a case to convince the employer that you have the ability
he or she is looking for.

The personal qualities that are espoused by the Girl and Boy Scout oaths (e.g., trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, clean, and courteous) are usually high on most employers' list of desired personal qualities. They particularly value trustworthiness,
reliability (such as showing up on time), and the ability to be a team member.

When top executives were interviewed and asked what helps workers succeed, they said these personality traits were the most important: enthusiasm (80.6%), "can do" attitude (65.1%), high energy (40.3%), and assertiveness (30.5%). Employers
look for these qualities. They want to know what you can contribute to the success of their company or organization.

What Are You Looking For?
Many individuals are no longer satisfied with working for a living but instead want to work at living. How does such a perspective fit your thoughts about the world of work? What are you looking for besides money?

Only about 45 percent of Americans are satisfied with their job, surveys show, and nearly all are seeking more time off and a better balance between work and leisure. As one observer said, "Do not spend your entire life climbing the ladder of
success only to realize that you had it leaning against the wrong building."

You have to make a living and being compensated for your work is clearly a high priority. Money is important, but it's not the only thing that people look for in a job. Often people continue to work when money is not the issue. Sometimes people
will change from a high paying job to one with lower pay because they believe it will be more satisfying.

Work environments influence how comfortable you are at your job. S with a pref for introversion, for example, who is required to do a lot of detail work or think through a problem, may find it disruptive to be in an environment that
is too loud or where a lot of interaction is required. When you know this about yourself, you can make arrangements to do your work in a more suitable location or at a time when there is less activity and interference. Otherwise, you are not likely
to work well in that environment or feel satisfied.

Even when circumstances make it necessary for you to do work that you have not chosen or which you must do as part of your overall job description, understanding your personality type can help you discover and use your strengths to accomplish
the work. When you find an unsatisfactory job fit, you can examine the reasons and seek solutions based on your preferences.
Some Realities of the Job Market

As you begin job hunting, it makes sense to look at the economy and job market to determine where the jobs are and the job outlook for the future. It's not possible to track every field in detail, but there are some trends described in national
publications that are worth noting.

Wondering where the jobs will be in the future? Government economists at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated which occupations would grow fastest between 2018 and 2028. They also predicted which occupations would have the most
new jobs. Some of these trends were presented in an earlier topic.

Many of the fastest growing jobs will be related to renewable energy and medical occupations. Additionally, occupations associated with expanding and adapting technology and those that focus on health care are expected to increase the most. The
lists of occupations with the most new jobs for Bachelor's degrees and Associate (2 year) degrees follow the same pattern, but also add such "hot" careers as teaching at all grade levels, nursing, personal care aids, accounting and auditing.

If the jobs on this list are too boring or unattractive, then you could consider the growing adventure jobs that are becoming available, where people try to combine work and play. Outside Magazine once highlighted filmmaker, photojournalist,
structural engineering, park designer, broadcast meteorologist, fitness center director and adventure travel guide as positions where people viewed their work as play more than work, or where an enjoyable hobby led to an occupation.

Another aspect of the new economy and job market is an increase in the number of temporary positions. People who work in these jobs are often called Temp Workers. Staffing firms report that 74% of temporary employees say it is a way to get a
permanent position and about 72% go on to such jobs. About 40% of assigned employees are looking for their first job or are re-entering the job market. Sometimes such temporary work fits a person's lifestyle, such as a stay-at-home parent, or it
may be a convenient way of trying out a line of work.

A look at data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics can provide a picture of where the more than 144 million jobs in our country are found. Figure 9.3(external link 04) shows the approximate percentage of the workforce employed in the four
work settings described earlier.

All work settings are affected by the health of the nation's economy, as well as by new developments in technology and international events and trends. Government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Labor http://www.bls.gov/(external link
05) and the U.S. Department of Commerce http://www.commerce.gov/(external link 06) provide valuable information through extensive electronic databases. There is so much information available that you will have to skim the facts and figures to
find the particular areas that will help answer your questions and that you want to research.

In addition, you will want to learn how to interpret the basic indices of our nation's economy. There are numerous public media sources, such as newspapers and television programs, specifically designed to discuss national economic indicators and
employment data. These will be presented in greater detail later.
Starting Your Own Business. A growing number of people, including many women and minorities, are choosing to go into business for themselves. For example, in 2019, women owned or controlled over 11 million enterprises in the nation and
own about 40 percent of small businesses. Terms that are used to describe people who are self-employed include: small business owner, b : p freelancer, private developer, or consultant. Of course, a business
does not have to remain small.

lig, dard.

During the 1970s there were a great number of hobbyists who took the risk of starting a new business to become entrepreneurs - some more successfully than others. Personal computers pr d, with no

of what these new machines could be or could do. It was an adventure shared by a virtual handful of enthusiasts.

and no preconceived notions

Bill Gates and Paul Allen were among the first of these early hobbyists to realize that the key to the future of personal computing lay in the unlimited potential of software. "This is it!" said Allen, waving the December 1974 copy of Popular
Electronics in his hand. "It's about to begin!" On the cover was a mockup of the MITS Altair, the first personal computer.

Gates and Allen recognized that the compact design of BASIC, a computer language developed at Dartmouth ten years earlier, made it ideal for the limitations of the first personal computers, which had extremely restricted memory and processing
power. Allen (age 22), employed by Honeywell and his friend Bill Gates (age 19), a sophomore at Harvard, immediately set out to adapt BASIC for the machine. Working day and night, they created the first version of MICROSOFT BASIC for the
Altair and their partnership was formed. Bill Gates dropped out of college to start his now internationally famous Microsoft Windows and products. It made him the richest person in the world throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the first prototype of a desktop computer in 1976. Wozniak was 26 years old and Jobs was 21 when they began working together in a garage on a preassembled computer circuit board. The first prototype took
about six months to design and 40 hours to build. It had no keyboard, case, sound, or graphics but it was the first desktop computer. They called it the Apple. Six months after the Apple Company started, Jobs and Wozniak were splitting a monthly
salary of $250. Apple's first formal business plan set a goal for sales to grow to $500 million in ten years. As it turned out, the company passed that mark in half the time.

Today there are organizations and website for young entrepreneurs (ages 19-35). They have clubs with memberships that offer programs, events, peer mentorships, networking and online magazines. Other examples of young entrepreneurs who
became very successful can be seen in Figure 9.2(external link 02).

Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. It takes a special talent and ambition. Before you invest time, energy, money and some of your passion, do some serious self-analysis. Answer such questions as: Am I prepared to work hard and make
sacrifices? Am I self-disciplined? Do I have management ability and skills? Am I experienced enough in this field? What do I want out of life? Are my goals realistic and attainable?

Studies have shown that entrepreneurs are persevering and not easily defeated. They thrive in a challenging environment and have a tremendous need to be in control. They are risk takers who turn adversity into opportunity. They welcome
responsibility and are willing and able to make decisions.

Moreover, successful entrepreneurs are patient and able to wait out the i slow beginnings of a business. They also are able to learn from their mistakes, trust their own judgment and have an optimistic outlook.

Do those traits describe you? "Know yourself and be willing to work 60 hours a week. Starting a business is one of life's biggest commitments," advises Roy Nordman, director of Emerging Business Services Practice in San Francisco, C.A. Small
business owner Nancy Wansick, of Wansick Graphics, echoes those sentiments: "My business has become my whole life. Day becomes night and work has become play."

It's obvious that you have to love your work. And if you choose a business that meshes with your personality, those extra hours spent won't be as difficult. The key is to identify what you enjoy doing the most and then find a business opportunity
that makes use of your skills and interests.

If you'd like to get a better picture of your potential for running your own business, there are some brief online quizzes you might want to check out. Liraz Publishing Company http://www.liraz.com/webquiz.htm(external link 03) provides an
interactive quiz that helps you to look at your strengths and weaknesses and describes the characteristics that appear most frequently among successful small business managers.
Factors To Consider
Before we go into the process and steps associated with job hunting, there are some basic factors to consider. These include the various kinds of work settings and the reality of the job market. Beyond that, it is important to consider the questions of
what employers are looking for, as well as what you are looking for in a job.

Four Primary Work Settings
You can organize a job search process by viewing your options in terms of four work settings: 1) Services to Others, 2) Industry, 3) Business, 4) Owning Your Own Business. Within each of these settings you can find the various types of
occupations and possible careers that we have been reviewing during our previous topics.

Theoretically, any of these settings might also be categorized as for-profit or non-profit. Nonprofit corporations and organizations can make a profit, but the business cannot be designed primarily for profit-making purposes and the profits must be
used for the benefit of the organization or the purpose that inspired the corporation. They may be public or private entities and may or may not be tax-exempt.

Providing Services to Others. State and federal governments are the largest not-for-profit employers, providing such public services as defense, law enforcement, transportation, public health and family care, and education. There are more than 21
million jobs in government settings. Nearly one in seven (about 14 percent) of all civilian employees works for the government.

We often associate federal government with Washington, D.C. Some people won't apply for a government job for fear of having to transfer there from where they are living. Actually, only 13% of jobs within the federal government are in the
nation's capitol area.

Salaries of government workers are paid out of tax revenues. They are usually stable and job security is high, unless there are unexpected budget shortfalls and jobs are terminated for lack of funds. Starting salaries are generally good, although
usually not as high as in business. Top administrative salaries do not rival those in profit-oriented organizations, where business executives can make more than the $400,000 paid annually to the president of the United States.

Government organizations are bureaucratic career paths and promotional practices are typically spelled out in a defined hierarchy of levels, with each level marked with certain ies and p

In addition to governmental agencies, over a million not-for-profit organizations and businesses provide services such as cultural enrichment, political advocacy, spiritual guidance, and charitable help for particular causes, groups and individuals.

Working in an Industry. Industries rep groups of companies that are engaged in producing similar products or services, such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola in the soft-drink industry or NBC, CNN, and ABC in the television industry. You can

investigate the industries that you find appealing and study their outlooks for the future. Be particularly aware of how they might be affected by new technology and other possible forces that can influence the industry's future. For instance, one
reason that the healthcare industry is growing so rapidly is that the Baby Boomers are getting older and beginning to need more health-related products and services.

Going Into Business. The greatest number of jobs, about 80%, is found in the business world, where there are more than 100 million jobs. This includes the 10 percent who are self-employed. The goal is to make money for owners. There is wide
range of salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefit packages in the business world. Compensation is tied to the success of a business. If your business prospers, then you are likely to prosper.

Entering the Job Market

Job hunting can be one of the most stressful experiences that a person can have, especially if it is from a cold start and you have no leads. The main cause of stress is that you have to sell yourself to others, usually strangers, and with little or no
training in how to do that.

Job hunting might be similar to asking someone out on a first date -- if the answer is no, then there is a feeling of rejection and it hurts. As a result, many people prefer to do as little as possible when trying to find employment and hope that, through
some miracle, a job will fall into their laps. This weak and failing strategy is often used even though these same job seekers know the importance of work in their lives.

Some students believe that their college degree is the same as a guarantee for a good job. The reality is that there are more college graduates than ever before and a college degree no longer makes it certain that you will find a satisfying and
high-paying job. You and other college graduates will be facing stiff competition for the best jobs.

Many graduates may end up underemployed in their first job after graduation. They find themselves in positions that do not make the best use of their knowledge and skills and that pay less than generally expected for someone who has a college
degree. They sometimes wonder if the expense of going to college was worth it.

The good jobs and the good career matches are out there. With some diligent effort and some useful techniques, you can successfully compete for them. If you approach the task with knowledge about yourself, careers and occupations, and the
process, then your chances of fulfillment are greatly increased.

No single job hunting strategy is the best one for everyone. You choose the strategies that make sense to you and feel right for you. You modify them to fit your needs and your job-searching plan. In this topic, we will take a closer look at entering
the job market and ways to increase your success.

Regardless of your college major, you must eventually accept the ge and resp ity of seeking employment. Your initial choices are going to affect the direction that you take on your career path.
Career Goals and Plans

It's time to review the career goals and plans that you have set for yourself.

What are your career outcome and performance goals? What skills do you need to learn in order to achieve your goals and feel successful? What help or or perhaps effort, do you need from someone else to move you toward your career goals?

You might also consider these questions. What barriers seem to be preventing you from reaching your goals? How are they blocking your progress and what needs to be done to remove or eliminate them? What assumptions have you made about your career goals and what information
do you need to make informed decisions and choices? Finally, are your goals too low or too high? Are they realistic and reachable?

When you achieve a performance or outcome goal that is related to your career development, take time to enjoy it. Celebrate it and welcome the satisfaction of knowing that you are making progress toward something that is important to you.
Realistic and Unrealistic Goals

One word of caution is that goals, whether they are based on outcome or can be and cause problems. This can happen when

+ Other people (e.g. parents, professors, media, society) set unrealistic goals for you based on what they want. They may ignore your personal desires and wants.

. or creates a muddled picture of what you are trying to achieve. If you are not informed, then you may be trying to achieve something that you lack the knowledge or skills to make happen.

+ Always expecting your best can be too This ignores the principle of regression, where things tend, at times, to slip back to the middle or the mean. It ignores the factors that to your best and assumes that they are always present.
Perhaps it is better to think of consistency rather than always best when you are judging your performance in an occupation career. Of course, there are times when you want to rise to the occasion, strive to compete at your highest level, and perform your best.

Too Low and Too High Goal Levels

There are some people who set their goals too low. They often do this because they fear failure. Optimum performance may require taking risks and to fail would cause too much psychological pain - feeling dumb, worthless, incompetent, undeserving and so on.

Therefore, some people set the bar low, knowing that they can clear it and avoid the and that comes when a goal is not reached. Others, fearing failure, won't even compete or take part or try very hard. They believe this keeps them out of harm's way.

For example, a young woman was the first female employee of a company that was traditional in its thinking, policies and office behavior. Although she liked her job, she always deferred to the men when it came time to be assertive and make decisions about company goals and activities.
She was unsure of herself and worried that her ideas would be rejected. This would not reflect well on “the role of women” in the business. She also assumed that the men had more knowledge and skill, when in fact this was not true.

It's true that they had expertise and more exp but the and skills that she was bringing to the company as a recent university graduate were equal to or better than many of her male colleagues. Her fear of failure kept her participation and goals low. Rather than face
possible challenges or the rejection of her ideas, she played it safe.

It is possible, of course, to slack off, to take things easy and avoid the pressure that is associated with higher goals. In this case, people look for reasons to set and keep low goals and often take a pessimistic attitude about higher ones. “Easy does it" is really "I lack ambition and I'm lazy."
Perhaps what they fear is the hard work and expectations that come with higher goals, thinking "This might be too much for me to handle. | could end up looking pretty stupid.”

Itis also possible that a goal can be so high that it is not likely to be attained. It can cause people to stretch and work hard; but, if it is an elusive one, then it opens the door for negative and low self-esteem. The question, "What's wrong with me?” may be off the mark. A better
question might be, "What's wrong with this picture?” Unrealistic performance goals are easier to identify than unrealistic outcome goals.

Aman in sales was atop and received awards from the company for his work. Over the years, however, the sales quota kept getting higher and higher. One day he was called into headquarters and questioned about failing to meet the sales quotas
that had been set. He complained that a continuous raising of quotas was unrealistic and stress producing. Despite years of success, he left the company and took a job selling real estate.

Goal Lists

Are you a person who constructs a daily "To Do" list and, at the end of the day, checks to see how many things were accomplished? If you are, then you are familiar with setting small goals and needing to do something to carry them out. You may not be as organized or motivated to write
such a list, but chances are you at least are mindful of things you want to accomplish in a day.

Written "To Do" lists can be helpful in many ways. As you look at the list you can prioritize the items, giving an A to those that need immediate attention because of an obligation or perhaps there is a greater pay-off or return for your effort, and a B to items that need to be done but with less
urgency. You can put a C by those that would be nice to have happen, but are not essential to meeting your daily needs and interests. You might now be thinking correctly that this strategy was designed by a left-brain thinking person and, if you are a right-brained thinker, then you were
lucky to have found the list.

Nevertheless, a written list of goals or items can also be rated in terms of realistic, practical, needing support, and “can do now.” Written words have a way of shouting things to you, if you pay close enough attention. Look for themes, key words, and patterns.

Although it is not always easy, you benefit when you take a long-term goal and systematically identify steps that lead to it. These steps may be expressed broadly, "| want to go to law school, " or precisely, "I want to make at least a B on the next exam in my statistics class.” Goals
expressed in a broad sweeping scope, “! want to be an accountant" require more immediate goal-setting, “I will pass my economics course this semester,” and then more immediate, "I will read Chapter Three in my economics textbook this afternoon in the library.”

Small steps add up and you can monitor your progress. Experiences are cumulative and usually make things easier as you move along. Learning one skill can lead to acquiring more skills, and so on. One of the reasons that so many people struggle with their majors and don't reach their
career goals Is that they only imagined “what could be” and spent too little time planning, setting goals, and then taking action on the steps along their chosen career path.

Once you have selected your goals and organized them into a plan, one that is sequential in terms of steps that must be taken, then you are ready for an action. Mentally making a decision is one thing, but it won't get you anywhere without putting your plan into real actions.

One student was determined to see an academic advisor and talk about the required courses needed for He kept making an Finally, one day dropped in the advisor's office, only to learn that her busy schedule did not enable her to see him at that time.
He probably got credit for taking a step in the right direction, but it was not a planned or timely one.

It was Mark Twain, in deciding to quit smoking who said, "It's easy to quit smoking; I've done it a thousand times.” To think something, to imagine it, to value it, is not the same as taking action on it.

Just as it is recommended that you review your "To Do" list at the end of each day, it makes sense to periodically review your career goals and steps. Things happen in life that make it necessary to modify plans or change priorities. To stay the course on your chosen career path, you have
to pay attention to which way the wind is blowing and adjust your sails.

Outcome and Performance Goals

Some people that you set rather than outcome goals to keep you focused on action rather than ideas. Performance goals make you more responsible for the behaviors that contribute to reaching your goal. Goals based on outcomes are more vulnerable because
they are out of your control. It is assumed that if certain actions are taken then the outcome will happen. However, there are many circumstances that can thwart an outcome from happening.

Performance based goals are focused on achievement behavior that can produce results. For instance, suppose that you were an artist and your work was being judged in a show. You did your best and friends and colleagues believed it to be among the best that you have done. But, alas,
the judges missed the concept and dismissed your work, and no award was granted.

If you had set an outcome goal to win the top award or to be among the top three, you would be extremely disappointed. You might feel defeated and discouraged. But, if your performance goals were to enter the show, follow the show's criteria and to submit your work, then you
accomplished some goals.

The problem with many outcome goals is that they are based on achieving something, whether this is a salary increase a financial bonus or a plaque for being salesperson of the year. While these goals can be highly motivating as they are achieved, over time, they becoming progressively
less motivating. They can lead one to focus so much on the destination that the journey there is disregarded.

Performance goals focus on your personal best, your standards, your self-image, and the behavioral expectations that you have for yourself. Again, you are in control of setting and monitoring such goals.
Goal Setting and Career Planning

At its simplest level, the process of setting goals and targets allows you to choose what you want to have happen in life. By knowing what you want to achieve, you have an idea of what you have to concentrate on, improve and do. It helps you sort out the distractions that can keep you
from going where you want to go.

Goal setting can give you long-term vision and short-term motivation. It helps you to view the big picture and the details that make it what itis. It is the of the lion of resources, and a source of commitment.

By setting clearly defined goals, you can measure your progress and take pride in your achievements. As you take note of your your self. increases and it is easier to have a positive attitude about life.

Career planning is a matter of goal setting. You start by reflecting on the things that you want to accomplish in life, the kind of career that you would like to have, and how such accomplishments can positively affect your lifestyle and those around you. It is a personal perspective that
involves an interaction of your needs, interests, values, knowledge and skills.

At this point in your career development here are some things you might be working on. Perhaps you have been creating a personal profile. You have been assessing your values and career interests. You have also identified some tentative work envi and careers
that appeal to you and you've been gathering information about them. Your personal and career goals are directly related to planning your career.

Some people can talk about their lifetime career goals in terms of the kind of work that they would like to be doing in 25 years. They can visualize it. For the rest of us, a 25-year plan is likely to be too complicated to construct. There are so many unexpected variables that will come into
play as you move toward those long-term goals.

It is probably easier to think in terms of related but smaller goals that can be achieved in a shorter timeframe, such as five years. This, in turn lends itself to being considered in terms of related but shorter-term goals, such as one year, one month, one week, or one day. As the saying goes,
“A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.” And, that can be a goal.
Deciding to Change Majors
You might be thinking, "But what if I'm on the wrong track?" Or, you could be agonizing over your current major and the courses that you are taking. "I'm miserable, I'm not doing well, and I'm losing interest in this major.”

If you feel boxed in to a life where every day is a repeat of the same miserable day before, at some point that becomes a tortured existence. It becomes an endless march through repeated grey days. Don't despair! There are some steps that you can take to put yourself in a better
position.

Some students try to mend the situation by “comforting themselves" with food, nicotine, alcohol, or other substances. In this case, perhaps the real for this p anguish Is to evaluate your career options and reconsider your course of study.

Peter Vogt, of Monster, describes five signs that indicate you should change your major (see Figure 8.12 (external link 12)). He also presents data from a study by the National Association of Colleges that asked over 1,200 college students how they picked their major. Only 66% said they
had picked a major based on their career interests.

A college major, of course, doesn't limit you to one type of work. For example, if you major in History, English, or any major for that matter, you might become a bank manager, sales representative, career counselor, production manager, or pursue a number of other career fields.

Your college major is only one variable in shaping your career path. The grades, electives, and skills you acquire through experiences in and out of the often tell employers as much about what you have to offer as your major does. Also, other factors such as your personal traits,
your goals, your (jobs, activities, volunteer work, internships), and your of and interest in a career field can play a large part in determining an employer's response to you.

Skills vs. Degrees

Remember a declaration of a college major does not indicate that a step-by-step career plan of action Is in place. There are a number of large corporations that are looking for employ who are g rather than They want people who can cultivate the complex
relationships that will help them to compete globally.

More specifically, there are certain types of skills that increase your emp Examine Figure 8.13 (external link 13), which shows the three types of skills employers are looking for: functional, specific knowledge, and personal trait. Study the examples and think of how they apply to
your college major or one that you are considering.

So, the question to ask is not “What can | do with a major in ?
Instead, the questions from a career planning perspective would be...

* What are the work settings and job functions that interest me?

* What can | do to explore and prepare for these options?

+ What related course work and hands-on experiences would be beneficial?

College majors can be quite confusing. Then again, if you have a grade point average of 0.00 like John Blutarsky (Bluto in the movie "Animal House”), it doesn't make much difference what you have declared as your major.

This is not the case in the real world, of course. If you intend to go into a restricted field that requires extensive study, such as medical school or engineering, then it is to your advantage to declare your major early and to stay focused. An academic advisor will help you outline the courses
you must take and there won't be many electives. Start now.
Choosing a College Major
Once you entered college, the inquiries of "What do you want to be (job) someday?" and "What college are you going to?" shifted to "What are you majoring in?" and "What do you plan to do when you graduate?”

The pressure to describe your career goals and what you are doing about them persists. You may not have definite answers, but you have already set some tentative plans into action. There are still choices to be made. For many students, one of the most difficult decisions to make is
choosing a major.

A college major is simply an organized collection of classes, either revolving around a subject (e.g., mathematics), theme (e.g., peace studies), or professional field (e.g., Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Your major rep’ of courses that gives you a basic knowledge
in a field of study. About one third of BA/BS program graduates also earn a grduate degree, more common in certain fields than others. Your major prepares you to go on for graduate work in the same field or for particular types of professions. A Chemistry major, for example, typically
prepares a student to pursue a Master's degree in chemistry or to take a job as a chemist in a pharmaceutical company.

Choosing an academic major is a necessary part of your college experience. Some students know exactly what they want to major in and what they want to pursue for a career. Some students have a few ideas and are trying to narrow their options. Some students have no idea where to
start. No matter where you are in the process, there are ideas and procedures that can help you.

It has been estimated that over 92% of students entering college have a major in mind. They feel confident about their choice. Fewer than 15% believe that they will change their major. Yet, researchers estimate that three out of four (75%) students change their majors at least once during
their undergraduate years.

Many people erroneously believe that for every profession there is a specific corresponding academic degree that goes with it, which may account for the high number of students entering college who have announced their intended major. While there are occupations that require specific
academic majors for certification (i.e. nursing and engineering), most do not. In addition, studies have shown that most graduates are working in career fields that are not directly related to their undergraduate program of study.

Nevertheless, some schools ask you to list a major choice on your college application but give you the option of checking “Undecided.” Most schools prefer that you start looking at a major at least by your sophomore year. If you are interested in a major that requires a lot of classes, or one
where classes are limited to only students in that major, you might have to declare earlier than usual.

You may envy some of your friends who have a declared major and seem focused on their careers while you are still trying to sort things out. If you are an older student and have been out of high school for some time, you may feel the added pressure of time constraints, as well as work
and family responsibilities. You may be wondering if your choice of a college major is right for you.

It is quite normal to be uncertain about the choice of an academic major and/or career direction when you first enter college. It is a time of exploration and self-discovery. It is a time for opening new doors rather than prematurely closing them.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, college graduates, on average, change jobs once every three years and change career fields two or three times in their lifetime. So, for those of you who think choosing a college major locks you into a specific career for the rest of your life,
you can think again.

Your immediate challenge is to choose a college major or confirm the one that you have already chosen. Many students select a college major without first gathering information about their interests and options. Others approach their choice of a major with misconceptions about careers
and majors.

Choosing a major is not the same as choosing a career. Studies show that your major in college is important for the first job out of college, but may not be as important for the rest of your career. There are many other considerations that affect the choice of a career.

Still, choosing a major field of study in college is an important step in the process of deciding your career direction. Your major shapes both your personal and professional development. It anchors your college experience. For some, it gives them a purpose for going to college.
Choosing a major that is interesting and motivating will you get better grades and help you to get more out of the major. A higher GPA can look good to future employers and will leave the door open to going to graduate school later, if you decide to go.

It may help you to begin with a broad perspective about how a college major fits with your life/career options. Try answering the questions in Figure 8.10 (external link 10) to help clarify your aspirations and expectations.

There are a number of common myths about college majors and careers that can interfere with your decision-making process in this area. Figure 8.11 (external link 11) takes a look at several such myths and offers some more accurate facts and to take into

Academic Advisors and Planning
Now that you are enrolled in college, your success will be influenced by many things, including useful advice that you obtain from others. A few words of advice from someone who understands the territory and the typical issues facing college students can be most valuable.

College advisors can help you plan your college education. A college counselor or advisor can help you work out a program of study that will lead to a degree and help you achieve your career goal. However, they are limited in number on most campuses and you may have to assert
yourself to get appointments with advisors and to make the most use of your time with them.

You can expect advisors to be candid and straightforward about your questions or concerns. Although they can provide you with useful information, help clarify degree req point to and and make don't expect advisors to make
decisions for you.
As a matter of professional courtesy, they are not likely to comment on or i or pi . Most of the impressions they have about faculty members are based on second hand comments from students that are not easily verified. Therefore, you will have to rely on

annual faculty evaluations and other resources to learn more about how a professor teaches and is perceived by students.

You can ask an advisor to help you determine an appropriate course load, especially during your first two years. It isn't easy to predict how much work is required for specific courses, but you can lay out a tentative timeline and schedule of courses related to your college major. These
need to be adjusted or revised as you learn more about yourself, your major field of study, and other options available or of interest to you.

College Dropouts
A college degree affects people in enduring ways. The college experience is a maturing stage in many young people's lives. In some ways, it may be coincidental that is also prepares students for job opportunities in the world of work.

Itis estimated that 45% of students at two-year institutions and 26% of students at four-year institutions drop out of school. Most drop within the first year and many within the first six weeks (American College Testing, 1998). The price for dropping out is high in terms of lifelong earnings
and personal development.

Most young people who begin post-secondary education have the academic ability to be successful. What, then, is the cause of dropping out? Academic factors play a part but problems with transition adapting seem to be more significant. Low motivation, poor study skills, financial
pressures, and emotional dependence on parents are also major contributors to dropping out.

There is evidence that most students who drop out do so without meeting with a counselor, an academic advisor, or their professors. They do not have a clear career goal in mind. They are unsure of their college major and fail to see the purpose of continuing to drift and experience a lack
of success. Many have not settled on a college major.
The Role of Education - An Easy Decision

Education is a vital part of preparing you for an occupation of your choice. We know that education will be required for more jobs in the future, especially the fastest growing ones. A college education is considered a wise investment and many people borrow money and go in debt,
assuming that the return on their investment will be worthwhile.

As college students graduated in the wake of the Great Recession, many of them struggled to find a good job, or any job at all. As a result, many questioned whether the time and expense of college was worth it. This question might be partially answered by comparing the economic
benefits of a college degree to its costs, as one would for any other investment. When compared to other types of investments, how does a college degree really stack up?

The answer is evident. Higher education is a much better investment than almost any other alternative, despite today's tough labor market. A college degree dramatically boosts the odds of finding a job and making more money.

On average, the benefits of a four-year college degree are equivalent to an investment that returns 15.2 percent per year. This is more than double the average return to stock market investments since 1950, and more than five times the returns to corporate bonds, gold, long-term
government bonds, or home hip. From any i persp college is a great deal.

For our purposes, the information contained in The Value of Education is of particular interest. Consider these compelling statements, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Commerce.
* The average salaries are 27% to 310% higher for college graduates.

* — Lifetime earnings are 80% higher for college graduates.

+ The dollar return can be 18-20 times the total cost degree cost but in many cases the high cost of student loans reduces the return significantly.

+ The employment rate is greatest for those with the highest levels of education.

College graduates overall make 84 percent more over a lifetime than those with only high school diplomas. But, major and occupation matter just as much as degree level. For example, 28 percent of people with an Associate’s degree make at least as much as the average Bachelor's
degree holder, mostly due to occupational choice.

An analysis of 171 majors shows that various undergraduate majors can lead to significantly different median wages. For instance, petroleum engineering majors make over $150,000 a year according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared with $50,000 annually for counseling
psychology majors. Math and computer science majors can earn $98,000 while early childhood education majors get about $40,000.

“It's important that you go to college and get a (bachelor's degree), but it's almost three to four times more important what you take,” said Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce. “The majors that are most popular are not the ones that make
the most money.”

According to a Georgetown University study, and individual with a Bachelor's degree earns an average of $56,700 per year, or $2.3 million over a lifetime. The report indicated that Bachelor's degree holders "earn 31 percent more than those with Associate's degrees and 74 percent more
than those with just a high school diploma.
Mind mapping is a popular tool for businesses and organizations that value and encourage the use of creative thinking and problem solving. It can also be applied to career planning and job hunting. For example, mind maps can be used to brainstorm potential networks and contacts,
generate examples of your competencies and strengths, or prepare for interviews and specific questions.

Figure 8.7 (external link 07) provides an example of how mind mapping might be used for career planning. This particular mind map was developed by Jonathan Wolff for the University of Derby, UK, Career Development Center. It shows how someone might use mind mapping to
brainstorm potential contacts for advice and information about careers in business. Note the use of colors, images, and multiple branches and sub-branches.

Career Visualization

A career visualization exercise is nears in Figure 8.8 (external link 08). It is a guided fantasy and serves as an example of something that you might do yourself or with another person who guides you through the mental images. In this case, you let your mind visualize decision-points
(forks in the road) and the feelings with the images. Sometimes a right brain exercise like this will provide insights or bring to your awareness matters that you hadn't considered before.

Six Thinking Hats

Six thinking hats is a decision-making model developed by Edward de Bono, an Australian scholar who taught and wrote about how people perceive the world and make choices. He wanted to help people move outside their typical thinking style and have a more rounded view of a
situation.

In de Bono's model, each “Thinking Hat" represents a different style of thinking. This approach is designed to encourage creativity in decision-making, as well as both intuitive and rational thinking. Figure 8.9 (external link 09) provides a brief description of the different styles that are
represented by the Six Thinking Hats.

The idea of looking at a decision from different perspectives doesn't have to be limited to the six hats. You may choose to think about your situation from the perspectives of different people that you Know (e.g., a parent, a best friend, a professor, a rival). Or, you may consider the situation
from the points of view with different (a doctor, a lawyer, a minister, a venture capitalist, a social worker). The point is to find a way to introduce perspectives other than your own into the process.

Forced-Field Analysis
If you have already decided on your plan, a Forced Field Analysis helps you to look at all the forces for or against the plan. This can give you an opportunity to plan for or reduce the impact of the opposing forces and strengthen and reinforce the supporting forces.

For example, Lauren is unhappy with her major and, through an elective class and campus club, she has identified another more promising major. Figure 8.6 (external link 06) shows how she used a Forced Field Analysis to help her identify the forces supporting and those opposing the
change. Then, she was able to make a plan to strengthen the forces in favor of her decision and reduce the impact of resistance to it.

An Intuitive Approach

Many successful people think from a very rational, positive viewpoint. This is one of the reasons that they are successful. Often, though, they may fail to look at a problem from an emotional, intuitive, creative, or negative viewpoint. This can mean that they underestimate resistance to
plans, fail to make creative leaps, and do not make essential contingency plans. On the other hand, may be y defensive, and highly emotional people may fail to look at decisions calmly and rationally.

For the most part, intuition is a great tool to use in solving varied career and personal challenges. Sigmund Freud's advice is legendary “When making a decision . . . in vital matters . . . such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from
somewhere within ourselves.”

People vary in what they find to be helpful when making decisions. While some prefer a structured method, others find an intuitive approach to be useful. Some learn to use both. Research has demonstrated that individuals who make efficient, effective, and wise career decisions combine
intuitive strengths with intellect or analytical thinking.

Mind Mapping
Mind mapping is a powerful visual method for collecting and recording i and ideas, pop by author and psychologist Tony Buzan. While this approach is more about creativity than structure, some procedures can help you get started.
The following guidelines are based on the work of Joyce Wycoff, co-founder of and author of Mindmapping: Your Personal Guide to Exploring Creativity and Problem-Solving.

=

Center First. The process begins with a word, phrase or image that represents what you want to think about placed in the center of a piece of paper.

2. Loosen Up. The process works best when you start with an open, playful attitude. You can always get serious later.

Free Associate. Write one or two words for each idea on lines branching out from the central focus. Allow your ideas to expand outward into more branches and sub-branches.

4. Think Fast. Use mental short-hand techniques such as key words, symbols and images to help you record ideas as quickly as they come.

a

Break Boundaries. Give yourself space and freedom to think outside the box. Use colored paper, markers, crayons, or a wall of butcher paper.

Withhold Judgment. Record whatever comes to mind. If you suddenly remember you need to pick up something at the store, jot it down somewhere on the page to help get that thought out of your way.

7. Keep Going. If your ideas slow down, let your hand just draw automatically, change colors, or stand up to get your mind reenergized.

8. Ease O izati are obvious and you can readily add sub-branches to a main idea or branch. Other times, they aren't so apparent, so just connect the ideas to the central focus. Get your ideas out of your head and onto the paper; organization can come

Paired Comparison Analysis
Paired Comparison Analysis is a good way to weigh the relative importance of different options or courses of action. It is useful when priorities are not clear or are competing in importance.

Let's suppose that a student named Justin will be graduating from community college and plans to continue his education at a 4-year college or university. Before he starts applying, he might take some time to think about some of the factors he wants to consider in choosing a school. For
Justin, certain things are given; he knows that he will apply only to schools that meet his needs in terms of degrees and majors offered and financial assistance packages.

He identifies some other factors that he'd like to compare.

When you look at Figure 8.3 (external link 03), you can see how Justin might have used a Paired Comparison Analysis to assess each factor against the others.

Grid Analysis
Grid Analysis is a useful technique when you have a number of good alternatives and many factors to take into account.

Chad graduated with honors in a specialized field and has several job options available to him. He wanted to compare these job options based on some factors (job satisfiers) he has identified as important.
In Figure 8.4 (external link 04), you can see how Chad might have used a Grid Analysis approach to compare and rate his job options and on the factors he chose.

If Chad is surprised or uncomfortable with his results, he may have underestimated the value of a particular factor. For example, he might adjust the salary value up to 5 and see how the revised results feel. If his results still don't feel right, it might be Justin's intuition is telling him that he
hasn't accurately expressed his true work values.

Plus/Minus/Implications
PML is a strategy that goes beyond pros and cons to take a closer look at a situation before taking action. It's another way to check whether taking a course of action is really going to improve your situation.

For example, suppose you grew up in a small town and attended college in a midsized town. Now you have graduated and are ready to move on. Before you begin your job search you want to give some consideration to where you'd prefer to live. Do you set your sights on a big city or do
you focus on areas more like what you are accustomed to?

You could develop a PMI table to list all the positive and negative points of taking a job in a large city. This approach will encourage you to list other interesting implications and possible outcomes that you haven't yet identified as positive or negative or that might be neutral.

A strongly positive score indicates that an action is supported, while a strongly negative score says that it should be avoided. As you can see in Figure 8.5 (external link 05), reaching for some interesting implications can add more factors to take into consideration.
Choice Overload

Barry Schwartz, in his book, The Paradox of Choice Why More Is Less, claims that we live in an age of “choice overload,” which creates stress, and dep If having a choice is good, then more choices must be better. That appears to be the prevailing trend these
days. A simple trip to the supermarket bears this out. Actually, it's not so simple anymore, as you are confronted with almost endless varieties of cookies, shampoos, cold remedies, sauces, tea bags, bottled water and so on. You can reach a point where you have so many choices that it is
paralyzing rather than freeing.

You have to sort out the choices, whether you are buying a car or deciding on a career path. It makes sense to research and study the situation. An informed decision tends to make people feel better about their choice, even if it does not fully meet their expectations.

Imagine that a company offers you a job. You research the company's history, track record and earnings, and future outlook. You talk with others about the company’s reputation and employee benefits. Things look good, but you are still not sure and wonder if you need more information
before you can make a decision. Perhaps it's time to step back a little and let your intuition be your guide.

You have to live with the choices you make. You're the one responsible for making them. This can cause you to feel a lot of pressure to make the "right decision.” However, you don't have to assume that the car you are buying is the only one you will ever buy or that it must last you several
years. Similarly, your first job out of college is not likely to be the one you will keep for a lifetime, even if it is in a field that will keep you employed until retirement.

If you have done your homework and you are still unsure about your choice, then perhaps the best decision is to not make a choice - at least at this time. You choose not to choose. It means that you are not ready. It might also mean that it's no longer worth the time and effort to dwell on
the matter. In not deciding, you have given yourself a message and made a statement about the situation.

Tips for Making Decisions

Here are some commonsense tips about decision-making:

=

Define the problem or the choices that you have. If you don't have a clear picture of the situation, then you might as well flip a coin because you're making decisions in the dark.
2. Consider all your options . Look carefully and completely at all that is available to you. You typically don't buy the first car that you see or marry the first person you date.

Decide what you want to have happen. In this case, think about what you really want, not what other people want for you or what they would choose for themselves. You probably don't let other people choose what you eat or which shows you watch, so don't let them choose whether
you should select a certain major or accept a particular job.

4. Learn from your mistakes. If you tried something that you did not like, don't do it again. If you ate some food that made you gag, you wouldn't touch it again. Why smoke a second cigarette if the first one made you choke? If working in a small cubicle all day long is boring and makes
you antsy, why apply for another job with a similar work environment?

5. List the consequences of your choice, from the little ones only you would notice to big ones that affect others too. You know if you don't study then you're not likely to do well on a test. Similarly, if you don't prepare to give a report at a company meeting you could do poorly and fail to
impress your boss and colleagues.
6. Be aware of the reasons you are making certain choices. Is it because you are feeling pressure from friends or family, or is it something you truly want? You wouldn't let your friends pressure you into swimming across a lake if you didn't think you were up to it, so why let them

pressure you into quitting your job to take a “road trip?”

A Logical Approach

Sometimes a choice or decision can be more clear when all the information you have about the situation is sorted out in a logical way. You can do this by using some common methods.
Trade-offs

You may be able to find an occupation that leads to a career that meets all your needs, with little or no compromises. More often that not, you will find that your choices involve trade-offs. You decide what is most important to you and it is reflected in your priorities. In addition, you decide
the extent to which your decision will be implemented.

For instance, you may consider one job that pays an excellent salary and allows you do business in a small area and another one that offers a base pay with lucrative commissions, yet requires a lot of travel and being away from home more often. Which one appeals to you? What are the
trade-offs?

A young man with small children chose a job with a regular daytime hours rather than one that took him away from his family for days at a time. What did he trade off? His income was less and buying a new house was delayed, but for him the time with his children while they were young
was worth it.

A woman wanted her two children to attend a private school with a “college prep" reputation. This meant taking a higher paying job with longer hours and leaving a position where she had close friends and felt comfortable. The trade-off (more time and stress on the job) was acceptable for
her, as she believed that the private school was key to her children's preparation for college and future success.

Trade-offs are somewhat different from ip A ip involves and some concessions so that the original plan is now modified. For instance, a man talked with his supervisor and they reached a compromise in terms of his doing more activities that would
increase income from his customers in one region, rather than reaching out for more business in another and more distant region. There was a consensus of agreement as to the new plan.

Trade-offs might be part of the process to arrive at a compromise, but in this case something is sacrificed or given up for something else. It is more like business, where buying and selling are involved. There is something of value that is exchanged. Something may
be acquired, but at an expense. A young couple decided to postpone starting a family and moved to a coastal city where they could enjoy the beach and spend more time surfing. They quit their high paying jobs in a metropolitan area, sold their sports car and purchased a used truck,
moved, and took lower paying jobs in “a bit of paradise.” It was an easy trade-off for them, at this point in their lives.

These examples also suggest that our choices often affect other people in our lives. We are all part of a bigger network of people; friends, family, colleagues and community.

A New Jersey couple decided to move to California. The jobs being offered there were "too good to be true and just couldn't be passed up.” The trade-off was that they would be leaving friends and an area familiar to them. They were also moving away from their children’s grandparents.
“We will have enough money to fly everyone back and forth.”

The outcome was predictable. The time spent with grandparents was less and the old friendships were reduced to holiday cards and a few phone calls. It was a life-altering decision that went well beyond career advancement. Interestingly enough, though, the couple felt so positive about
what resulted from the move that they seldom talk about losses or what might have been.

Decision Readiness
We often postpone or neglect making a change or a decision until we reach a certain level of personal discomfort. That level depends upon each individual, as some people have more tolerance for uneasiness than others and, thus, can delay making decisions longer than others.
A list of questions for assessing one's readiness for making career decisions might be helpful. How would you respond to the readiness questions in Figure 8.2 (external link 02)?

It is evident that dissatisfaction is frequently the key to decision readiness. Most people will not make the effort involved in career planning until they feel pressured and enough to take action. There are, of course, people who are planners and, as part of their lifestyle,
they plan ahead and build their career plans. They still experience a measure of discomfort and concern - enough to engage them in the career planning process.

Factors Affecting Decisions

Teachers often use games to teach a concept. For example, there is a game that uses three paper cups that are upside down on a table and shuffled around. Under one paper cup is a bag of sweets (e.g., candy) and under the other two are stickers with frowning faces. If you pick the cup
with the sweets, you get a treat. Pick one with a frowning face, and you will be squirted with a water pistol.

The game is supposed to be a fun way of teaching about the consequences that come with making choices. "Instead of blindly guessing and picking the cup,” a teacher said, "...you can usually get more information about what your choices are. The more information you have, the better
chance you have of making the best choice.”

Interestingly enough, after such a game progresses, some children like being squirted with water because the other kids hoot, holler and laugh gleefully. The consequence of the water pistol is no longer unpleasant. It goes beyond the water pistol to receiving more attention than those who
pick the cup with candy.

You may think a particular job will bring the kind of financial benefits and independence you always wanted, only to find out that the "treats" weren't quite what you expected. Even though a particular job pays well, it's possible to envy those who make less money in another job but get
more attention for their work and contributions. Money is not the only reason that people work.

We know there are consequences to every choice. We also know that they can be pleasant or unpleasant. However, we are not always sure of how many consequences (outcomes) are involved and which ones are valued and reinforcing. There may be hidden pleasant or unpleasant
consequences that can make a job worthwhile or no longer attractive.

A science teacher, who had once planned to be pharmacist, was at a social gathering and was talking casually with a pharmacist, who had once considered being a teacher. The pharmacist said, "! wish | could afford to be a teacher because it sounds a lot more interesting than what | do.”
The teacher responded with a laugh, "I wish | made the money that you do, but I'm never bored.” Both remained in their jobs.

Compromises
Suppose that you went to the cupboard this morning and couldn't decide whether to have a bow! of Special K or Cornflakes. After a little contemplation, you decided on a mix of both. When faced with choices, we often wish that we could compromise - and have little of each.

There are career choices that allow you the possibility of compromise. In this case, you are looking for more than one outcome and seeking a blend of things that you value. You probably want the best of both possible worlds. This takes in-depth assessment and careful planning. It will
require creative efforts and perhaps a situation where you can create your job.
Career Decision-Makers

There are a number of unproductive decision-making styles that a person can fall into. At the same time, we also know that most people can productively make decisions on a rational or an intuitive basis. Depending on your personality, you probably have a tendency for one or the other.
About 75% of the population prefer and use a rational decision-making approach.

Rational decision-makers follow a logical or linear approach, which, as we know, draws upon the left side of the brain. It is a more analytical and deductive way of making choices and, ideally, follows step-by-step procedures that lead in a given direction.

In choosing career rational decisi Kers frequently consider money and will take a practical approach in assessing a situation. They make lists and carefully consider the pros and cons, with a structured working environment being high on their list of priorities. They like the
steps of a career ladder to be spelled out in detail. This is the most popular decision-making model for career planning found in most published materials and college and university career development centers.

The intuitive decision-making approach is one where people make choices based on what feels right to them. They use their right brain more when given options and thrive on imagination, visualization and creativity, and are willing to make spontaneous adaptations.

When engaged in a job search or career planning, intuitive decision-makers look at several alternatives that could be satisfying and try to get a feel for the overall picture of the job or occupation. They talk to people, walk around the work environment, and may look at the pros and cons of
their options, but they almost always pick where they think they will fit in. They rely on a hunch or a gut feeling that tells them it is the best choice for them and that it fits their personality.

Intuitive decision-makers almost always give more credit to luck than do rational decision-makers. However, their luck is frequently a case of when "preparation meets opp and they seize upon it. Rationale decision-makers, on the other hand, often have a written plan and give
attention to details, which makes them feel more in control and gives them confidence in making final choices.

At the Kent State University Career Services Center, you can learn more about your career decision-making style. It's easy. Answer a few questions in a short exercise to determine your typical style. Go to http://www.kent. your-decision-making-style (external link 01). If
you are curious about some styles of career decision-making, then view the information on the four styles presented at this site (Sp xternal, Sp xternal and Systematic/Internal). Compare and contrast and consider the career exploration
activities.

Career decisions are difficult -- more difficult than buying a car and perhaps more difficult today than in the past. Today's world might appear particularly unnerving, especially if you've observed a parent or family friend lose a job. You may have witnessed some of their personal and
financial problems that result from being unhappy in an unplanned occupation. You may be thinking that you don't want a job to rule your life, but it does play a major role in how you cope with life.

Changes in the economy can make us feel as if we're on a giant rollercoaster of constant change. So, if you can't avoid them, why not just go along for the ride? Why not look at your future as a colossal dice game, where chance will determine your successes and your failures? This is too
much a case of throwing caution to the wind and hoping for the best.

The goal is to manage your future, not let fate or chance or someone else plot your course for you. The choices you make everyday -- to learn a new skill, do well in a particular class, look into a nontraditional career, find out about financial aid -- are all part of your career plan, and you are
in charge.

There are some people who seem to have all the answers, to have a clear picture of their dreams and to be well on their way to where they want to go. But when it comes to careers, everyone is unique. We make choices in different ways, at different times, using different methods. And
someone who has made a clear choice today may need to rethink that choice in the future.

Good career decision-making is not a single decision, but a series of decisions over the course of your life. Good career decisions require that you understand yourself and the world in which you live, especially its work and educational opportunities. Good career decisions attempt to
balance your needs and strengths with the realities of the labor market.

In its simplest form, career decision-making Is a three step process - to know oneself, to know the world of work, and to make a decision based upon both. That third step is one that you might repeat over and over again as you change your college major, make transitions between jobs,
balance family and work, or move from school to school.
Career Decisions and Goal Setting

It's easy to make a decision. We think about a situation, consider the facts at hand, follow our intuition, and reach a conclusion. Thus, a decision has been made - at least intellectually.

We make decisions every day, almost all of the time. There are many choices. We decide where we want to be at the moment, even if the physical space is very limited. We decide actions that we want to take, even if it is about mundane things, such as how long to let the hot water run
when you are washing your hands. We choose the kind of attitude that we bring to a situation - positive or negative, excited or passive. We choose to think quietly or to talk with someone about something. We decide to make a movement toward or away from something. We choose to
think about the past, present or future. Making decisions about the choices we have is part of being human.

Most of our everyday decision-making is a small part of a bigger picture. The little choices that we make, many at only a low level of awareness, are linked together to form a pattern of thinking, feeling and doing. We learn to manage small-scale decision-making by trusting our values,
interests and skills, and by forming habits and routines. The choices we make, how we feel and what we do are outgrowths of our personal identity and how we see ourselves in a given situation.

Career Decisions
On occasion, some choices loom as more significant because they have vital implications for how we live and our future choices. The decisions we make about our career options, for example, are central to our well-being, personal development, and lifestyle.

Decisions about occupations and careers seem more momentous, although they too can be made without much awareness. They take their place among life's turning points, such as deciding to settle in one city or another, to attend graduate school or not, or to form a long term
relationship with another person. Of course, within each of these examples, there are numerous other decisions to be made.

When you know yourself and the options open to you, you can make a career decision. To do this, you need to relate your self. to the you have gained about the options you identified and explored as part of your career search. At this point in your career search, you
may have defined your interests, skills and values and matched these to some relevant occupations. If so, you're ready to make some more critical decisions. But, how does this work?

Making important decisions on your own can be challenging. It is all too easy to "go with the flow,” do what your friends are doing, or try to hand over the decision to someone else. A lack of self-awareness, a low level of confidence, or a shaky grasp of the available options can result in
poor decision-making. Sometimes it is too easy to think that you can worry about your future some other day, allowing yourself to decide by default to let things slide.

Some decisions are considered irrevocable or limiting. Once you decide, it is extremely difficult to change your mind or your actions. If you invest your money in the stock market and your investment goes sour, you must suffer the consequences. You cannot go back in time and switch your
money to another stock or fund. If you decide to join the military, you will have to honor that choice until your obligation is finished. There are jobs that require you to sign a yearly contract, such as classroom teachers do.

In reality, most decisions do not have such power over our lives. We too often assume that, if we could only make the right decision, then everything else would fall into place and we would be happy. There are not that many decisions in life that are either black or white in terms of
consequences. They simply move you in one direction or another along your chosen path.

When decisions are made they, in turn, open the door to some more options and close the door to others. If you assume that most decisions are not of a life-or-death nature but can be changed or altered, then decisions do not have to weigh so heavy as to be paralyzing or make you feel
incapacitated.

There are consequences to any decision, but you can usually make adjustments or modifications, as well as new decisions. It is only a matter of accepting the and taking for any decision that we make.
Letting your imagination run in this direction can be an interesting experience. Give it a try. Close your eyes and imagine an ideal workday sometime in the future when you are well established in an occupation of your choice. Then ask yourself these questions:

+ What am | wearing?

Where is my working taking place?

What am | doing?

Who am | working with?

What kind of expression do | see on my face?

What's the overall feeling that | are getting as | imagine such work?

Now, what kind of information is missing? Were you drawn to any particular aspect of the fantasy? You can use the experience to identify areas you want to gather more information about so that you can fill in the blanks. The imagination is a powerful tool that needs to be exercised in the
career chase.

At this point you know that a career search is not just looking for possible jobs. It begins with some basic and about the world of work. You engage in self-assessment so that you know more about yourself as you look for career opportunities that seem to match
you.

Perhaps the first principle for a career search is that you must put in the effort to make it productive and worthwhile. There is no shortcut, although there are many tools and strategies that can make the task quicker and easier. It is neither an easy process nor one to be taken for granted.
An organized and active search can pay many dividends in time, money, and personal satisfaction in the years ahead. Your career search efforts will be worth it.
Work Activity Related Experiences

There are different ways that you can learn from work settings. You can put yourself directly in a related job, or you can use a little i and i ly try to one. For example...
Taking a job.
You can gain information by working in related practices and internships, summer jobs and volunteer work. "Hands on” experience in a line of work is invaluable and the most preferred way of exploring an occupation.

Your eyes and ears will take in things that no book or website can communicate. You are there experimenting with some tasks related to the line of work. Even if you are working at a low-level job or perhaps only assisting in a project or some special tasks, being in the work environment
will let you sense if this kind of work appeals to you.

In addition, there is no substitute for work experience. It's one of the first questions that will be directed your way by employers when you start job hunting. A college degree alone will not compete with experience, and even a little experience will you give you an edge when it comes time
for hiring decisions. Most important, work experiences give you a realistic and informed base upon which to make career choices.

Job Shadowing.

In this case, you have permission to follow a worker through a typical workday. This experience allows you a more “up-close and personal” look at the job than an Information Interview would provide. You can observe what he or she does and get a feel for the work environment. You can
help out with minor tasks, if invited, but as a shadow your primary role is to be a keen-eyed observer and listener. When the opportunity presents itself, you can also ask questions that provide some insights and clarify the line of work.

Job shadowing is an inexpensive way to learn about a job that appeals to you. You may walk away with more questions than answers, but the experience can also spur you to do further research on the Internet or in a CRC.

When you shadow someone you will discover elements and details in a job and work setting that are not easy to describe in reference books. On the other hand, recognize that the experience is only a sampling technique for one day and should not be considered as an all-inclusive picture
of what can happen in that line of work. In addition, you have to consider the person whom you're shadowing and try to decide how much you are like and different from the person.

More recently, some companies have developed search tools for students and job seekers that use streaming video technology. It enables people to connect with the workforce via their computers and view a behind the scenes look at life on a job (e.g., see samples at
VirtualJobShadow.com). Profiles are provided and an interactive video (questions and answers) makes it possible to seek advice from professionals.

Watching television documentaries.

Shows related to specific occupations can enable you to gain insights into an Public tend to be more objective and heir but a spark of interest will be fired. To be sure, there are people who have entered certain
occupations because they were drawn into it by such exposure and even through popular television programs. TV scripts, of course, are selective and tend to slamoree jobs in order to entertain or gain attention.

Imagining a typical workday.
Other Methods and Resources

Campus Related Information Sources
One of the advantages of the college experience is that it provides a place where you can find many written sources of information, as well as people to talk with about career interests.

Browsing through textbooks.

If you think you want to be a finance manager, then go to the bookstore and browse through some books to get an idea of the field's subject matter. As you skim the table of contents in textbooks, do the topics interest you? Does it appear to be an area that you might want to pursue further
and study more in depth?

Taking related courses.

Perhaps a course or two directly associated to an occupational field can provide useful information for making decisions. For example, if you take a biology course but find some of the tasks and lab experiments boring, then you may want to reconsider any plans you have for entering the
medical field. Or, if you take a sociology course and find the content fascinating, then you might want to consider fields such as city and so forth. Look for career-related trends and patterns that have meaning for your occupational options.

Talking casually with people.

ie with and other students about work environments can also be stimulating and help clarify your interests. Talking with others can add to your energy and commitment in terms of work-related interests. If you find, on the other hand, that talking about
things in detail is tiresome, then you may want to look at occupations that are less detailed oriented and avoid fields like accounting.

Joining related university and

There are many benefits to getting involved in groups and activities related to a career goal. It puts you into contact with others who have similar interests. It can be motivating. It may also give you some experience and skills that are related to job functions and tasks in your career. For
instance, being involved with campus leadership activities might develop interests and skills that are to an where you work someday.

Job, Co-operati and p Listings.

You don't have to confine your job search to newspaper classified ads and online search engines. Most career centers keep updated lists of entry-level jobs, co-ops, and internships, either on paper or online. They don't like to be viewed as job placement centers, but most CRC staff
members are active in helping students get connected with job co-op programs, i and other ities that can provide valuable experience and contacts.

ResuMania and Joba Cafe

The Georgia State University Career Resource Center provides many of the typical resources to assist students in career development and guidance. The Center hosts, for example, "ResuMania." It is provided daily. It is when career and other p sit down
face-to-face to help someone create a resume that employers will perceive favorably.

In addition, GSU also offers Joba Cafe, a multipurpose lounge, where students can spontaneously stop by for discussions and explore ideas. One student said it was where she learned about campus interviewing, a program that connects company representatives with a student whose
resume was selected or who was referred.

Clearly, the Center is trying to appeal to students and encourage them to use some of the services provided. At the same time, career counselors recognize that not every student who is enrolled at the university will or can take advantage of what the Center has to offer. The Center would
be overwhelmed. Therefore, more efforts are being made to provide timely assistance through the Internet. Online programs typically have the benefit of being available and able to assist all students, no matter how large the student body.

Some CRC Misconceptions

Caprice Lanta, of Jobweb.com, reported that a recent national survey of college career center professionals found that many college students have misconceptions regarding various career and job-search issues as well as the services provided by campus Career Resource Centers. This
may account for part of the reason that many students have never been to their campus CRCs. In addition, they may be hesitant to confront or reveal their uncertainty even in a resource center designed to help them with that very issue.

The following, for example, are among these misconceptions.

* "I don't have time to use my college career center. Using my career center is not important until close to graduation.”

* "College career centers are like employment agencies they ‘place’ students in jobs.”

“Career centers have job listings and on-campus interviews, and they attract employers to attend job fairs for every major and interest.”

“| should be able to walk into my career center and get immediate assistance.”

That last misconception is almost always bound to lead to disappointment or frustration due to unfavorable student-staff ratios. An informal survey, regarding the ratio of career center staff to students at 27 U.S. colleges, found that many college career center staff are spread thin. In the
best-case scenario there were 250 students to each staff member. The worst-case put the ratio at 7,400 to1.

In reality, most colleges and universities cannot afford to staff their CRCs adequately enough to provide services to every student on their campuses. Therefore, the students who are most assertive, who take the time, and who make the effort are the ones who benefit most from these
resources.

The counselors and career staff at a CRC are prepared and want to help. It is impossible for any one person to be knowledgeable about every profession. While counselors usually can provide general information, unless they have first-hand exp in an p orp they
are often not the best people to answer specific questions. More often, career counselors provide direction in terms of where to find resources that can answer career questions. Doing the actual research, however, is up to you.

Career center staff members work in career services because they sincerely want to help people. They are often willing to go to great lengths to provide assistance. If you go to a CRC, help the staff to help you by understanding their limitations and by learning what you must do to help
yourself.
Computer-Assisted Career Guidance Programs

Computer-Assisted Career Guidance Systems (CACGS) are computer programs that guide you through the career exploration and choice process. Typically, a CRC will have computer stations in the room where you can access a program on the Internet or use one of the computer
systems described briefly below.

A computer is only a machine, and a program can process only what you tell it, nothing more. That's why it's so important for you to think hard and respond honestly to the questions, even those questions you've never really considered or that you find hard to answer. Make the best choice
you can based on what you know and believe at this point in your life. In this way, the career information presented will be as accurate as possible.

There are several programs that can help you with self-assessment and decision-making. Colleges and universities lease these software programs in order to offer them for free or inexpensively to students.

Programs like SIGI 3 (System of Interactive Guidance and Information), DISCOVER and Choices require users to answer a variety of questions about interests, skills, and values. Based on those answers, the software comes up with a list of careers the user may be interested in. There's a
component that allows users to gather information about these careers. For more information, click on these hyperlinked terms

* Choices (Figure 7.4 (external link 11))
+ DISCOVER (Figure 7.5 (external link 12))

+ SIGI3 (Figure 7.6 (external link 13))

Career Counselors and Specialists

Career counselors and advisers can meet with you one-on-one or in small groups to discuss your plans and help you find a focus. They can also introduce you to the resources in the CRC and coach you in how to best use them. Most of the counselors will be licensed or certified in
counseling and guidance.

They are also prepared to make referrals to the campus mental health services when appropriate. If they discover, for example, that a student is experiencing excessive anxiety and stress, then a referral might be made, especially if the career counselor does not have the experience or
time to provide assistance at the CRC. Except in unusual cases, this is only done with the permission of the student or client.

Workshops, Seminars, Career Fairs, and Video Conferencing

Counselors and other CRC staff will often provide workshops and seminars that are available to students in small groups. These are generally short in duration and limited inn time. Topics vary but often include Doing A Career Search, Building Your Resume, Successful Job Interviews, and
Job O

Career centers often sponsor sessions in which students can meet representatives of one or more companies and learn what they have to offer. these are alumni and can relate how their experiences at a college or university translate into their current careers.

Career Fairs are occasions when you can meet several employers at once. Most career service centers sponsor at least one Career Fair or Career Day a year. Staff members can also point you to fairs at nearby colleges and universities. Recruiters from a variety of companies, agencies,
and even the federal government often spend a day or several days on campus interviewing students.

Once a mere novelty, web and video conferencing have become popular ways for companies to interview remote candidates and offer training to distant users. Real-time video conferences can be set up between a student and a potential employer. These services have become a
standard offering at many universities. Internet video conferencing allows some of the same capabilities for much less cost, and CRCs often offer these services or can arrange them.
What do you do during the interview?
At the beginning, introduce yourself and thank the contact for making time available for you. Restate your purpose and be prepared to initiate conversation. Make natural eye contact throughout the interview. Be confident and speak clearly.

Be prepared to share a little information about yourself but do not dominate the ion. Ask probing ded questions to draw out information. Do not ask a lot of questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no. It's a good idea to group your questions under headings,
but be prepared to follow the lead of the person you are interviewing. You will need to use good istening skills in order to make the best of the information that you are given.

Given the purpose of information interviews and that they are generally less intense than formal job interviews, questions can be asked that may not seem strategic in an employment interview. You can explore the typical daily routines of the profession or field; ask questions about benefits
and salary, as well as pitfalls; and, learn about what the contact likes best and least about the job.

Although this may seem obvious do not counter, argue or contradict. You can evaluate the information later. Close the interview well, making sure to express your appreciation and thank your contact for the time spent with you.
What next?

It is good practice to send a thank you letter or e-mail a few days after your interview. Evaluate the information you received. Does it relate to your plans? This is a good time to also evaluate your style of interviewing. What worked well and what needs to be amended in the future?
Career Resource Centers

Almost every community college and university has a Career Resource Center (CRC). It may also be called the Career Center (CC), Career Development Center (CDC), or Career Services (CS). It may be a part of the Student Services program at your university or it could be located in
another department. Often the centers are located in student unions or other high traffic areas on campus. In addition, the CRC will offer information and a number of services online.

The career center at your college or university can be a valuable-and sometimes fun-place to visit. So what can a trip to a career center do for you? How can a career counselor or adviser help you? There's more there than you might think.

The CRC on your campus will probably look like a small library. This library, of course, is and is ly arranged so that you can use the career materials and move through the center with relative ease. The following are just some of the services that college and
university career resource centers and offices offer. Go to Figure 7.3 (external link 10) to see an overview of resources and services that are available at a typical state university.

CRC Library and Publications
One of the first things you will notice will be the books, brochures, handouts, and other publications that are either shelved or lying around the room for your use. Here you will find many of the large and bulky reference books that provide useful information. For example, expect to find

* The Occupational Outlook Handbook

The Dictionary of Occupational Titles

The Dictionary of Holland Occupational Codes

The Guide for Occupational Exploration

* The Career Guide for Creative and Unconventional People

The College Majors Handbook

O*NET Dictionary of Occupational Titles

Most career centers keep plenty of information about employers me for browsing. This can include company brochures, annual reports, news articles, and listings in guides. Many also maintain collections of reference books,
guides that contain information on mergin salaries, and graduate schools, resume writing, interviewing, and more.

What is the value of Information Interviews?
They can be a step in building a network and uncovering some career paths not previously considered. They can highlight gaps and areas in which you need to improve. During an interview you try to figure out how to “break in" and “succeed” in a chosen field. You can also
* Mentally sample an occupation or company and imagine your personal “fit.”

+ Gain information about the hidden job market and unadvertised positions.

Identify your professional strengths.

Enhance your self-confidence because you are in control of the questions.

+ Make a favorable impression on someone who could recommend you for a job.

+ Find out specific information that goes beyond books and websites.

Prior to an interview obtain as much information about the industry or occupation as you can. Go to the company’s website or brochures and read about its profile and mission. Try to discover in-depth information that is not readily accessible in the marketplace.
Who should you interview?

Who you interview is only limited by your imagination. They may be people at a job site, a professional meeting, a career fair, or someone you met through another acquaintance. Once you have obtained a name or two, a thank-you note to the person who gave you the contact is a social
nicety.

Although an information interview is not a job interview, you can still present yourself as if it were. Research suggests that approximately 70 percent of jobs are in the hidden job market; therefore, dress to make a good impression. It is possible that you will uncover employment
opportunities that can be followed up after the interview is over.

How do you plan for the interview?
Here is a checklist to help you prepare for the interview
+ Dress well. Business attire is usually appropriate.

+ Prepare your questions and have them in a clean professional folder.

Be prepared to take notes, after getting permission, as you may need to take down the names and contact information of referrals.

+ Prepare a copy of your latest resume that is tailored to the company and position, as you understand it, but distribute it only upon request.
+ Know your way to the office or building and arrive 10-15 minutes early.

+ — Stick to the agreed time limit for the interview.

+ Be confident and enthusiastic; after all, you are the interviewer.

How do you set up an Information Interview?

You will need to contact the people you wish to interview by phone or emnail to schedule an interview. Remember that they are generally busy; therefore you will need to be flexible with your time and request no more than 20 minutes. Explain that you are trying to obtain first-hand
information to aid in your career exploration and decision-making.

Sometimes your contact person will ask you to conduct the interview then and there. It is important that you have your questions ready in this event, because this may be the only chance you will have to obtain the information that you are seeking.

If a contact is unable to grant you any time, ask for a suggestion for another contact and permission to use his or her name when contacting the person. When requesting an information interview by letter or e-mail, your request is less immediate than a phone request and possibly less
effective as it does not require a response. You may need to follow up with a polite phone call.
Life Profiles

It's tough to visualize what a working day in a particular occupation is like if you haven't already worked in the field. Who better to describe life on the job than the people who work in those jobs? It isn't always feasible to visit someone on the job, so reading a person's real life account of a
“typical day” may be the next best thing. Here are some ways you can get access to some personal profiles.

Part of what makes a job attractive is that the day-to-day work varies significantly depending on different and challenging tasks. You can gain an idea of the tasks and routine in a job by talking to someone who is employed in a field of interest or perhaps by reading an account of the day in
the life of a particular occupation.

Go to Figure 7.2 (external link 08) and click on a few of the profiles there.
Internet Searching.
Another way to read about what people do in their work is to use the Internet and search the words, “day in life of " and complete the phrase with a job title that interests you. For example, after googling “day in the life of sales representative" several sites appeared where representatives

described a typical day for them. For instance, a magazine ad sales representative described the of 15 per week or three per day one in the morning, one at lunch, and one in the afternoon. Record keeping, follow-ups, answering messages, and other related
tasks have to be managed throughout the day. It how time is a critical factor in sales.

Tell us in your words ‘What does a day in your work life look like?’ This question is one that is often on people's minds as they explore occupations.

One interesting website that provides more than a hundred responses by people who work in certain jobs can be found at Vault http://www.vault.com/day-in-the-life-of_(external link 09). Under the topic Career Advice and "A Day in the Life” there is a list of respondents who talk about a
typical day on the job. For example, you can read about a day in the lives of an investment banker, a plaintiffs’ lawyer, fashion buyer, venture capitalist, tax p' software p' real estate agent, and physical therapist, among others.

Information Interviews
You can also find useful information and clarify your goals and interests through Information Interviews. By interviewing people about their occupations, you will discover things that cannot be found in even the best reference books or most inclusive websites.
Talk with personal contacts who are available in your area, or ask people you know whether they know someone working in the occupations you want to explore. Your campus career resource center may also have a list of potential interview contacts.

An interview is a highly effective way of getting some inside information and helpful hints about occupations. Most people enjoy talking about their work and are happy to spend a few minutes talking about themselves and the nature of their work. In addition, they may be able to provide
more immediate and straightforward answers to your questions than other sources.

Information Interviews can be part of searching and exploring careers. They can also be a networking and job-hunting strategy. They involve interviewing people who are currently in a particular job or company. An Information Interview is not the same as a job interview, where you are
more focused on employment and selling yourself to an employer.

When considering career paths many people rely upon ideas gleaned from friends, family, TV, books, movies, and the popular media. These can be inaccurate and misleading. In order to make an informed career decision, it makes sense to ask the experts who are actually in the
occupation or field that interests you. Because of its exploratory nature, the Information Interview can be enlightening for university students and career changers.
The Journey Continues with Exploring

Knowing where to find information is the first part of learning about careers. The second step is to delve into the sites and publications to learn more about specific jobs and occupations. During this exploration process you will discover things that you like and dislike about certain jobs ar
occupations, as well as gain some insights about yourself and the career chase.

Using your three selected jobs or occupations as a starting point, you can visit a website and learn more about a career, as well as what the site can offer you. By using the same three occupations each time, you can find out how consistent the websites are in providing similar informati:
You will also find that sites present their information in different formats and, while there will be some overlap, there are bits of information unique to each site. In addition, you will find that some sites seem easier to navigate than others and that you prefer some sites over others.

CareerOneStop

This might be a good place for you to get started. Here's how it works. Go to_CareerOneStop http://www. org (external link 07).

To get a feel for how the site works, click on Explore Careers. Then, click on Explore Careers. Under the title Occupations, you will see such links as Browse, What's Hot, Compare Occupations, and Research Industries. This suggests that there is a lot of information at this site alone.
Click on “Career Profiles” and this will take you to Occupation Profile.

Now, search for one of your three occupations that you've chosen to explore by entering the job title in Word Search. You will get a list of related jobs.

You can search each of the 3 occupations you chose to explore by using the keyword search bar. You will see that for each job and occupational description is provided and you also indicated a preferred state residence.

Some profiles have a video that can be viewed. State and national wages are listed, along with state and national employment trends.

The profile continues with information about related knowledge, skills and abilities. Some general and specific work tasks and workers activities are listed, as well as possible tools and technology required.

Of special interest to you will be the Education and Training section. Here you will find most common educational levels of those in the field and links to colleges and instructional programs. There are also some related web resources and an opportunity to narrow or modify a search for
information about a particular aspect of the occupation, including an update tab.

After following the links on your three chosen occupations or jobs, you can explore the site more by returning to the first or "nome page" and click on some of the other tabs, such as Salary + Benefits or Education + Training. This approaches an occupation search from a more specific
interest. Likewise, you can take note of how opportunities are available in certain geographic regions or states.

You will also find some interesting questions and links in colored boxes on the home page. As you roll over the boxes you will find leads to help you think about your future, goals, income, and other things to think about. This is a site worth “surfing” around for information.

Needless to say, this is a very comprehensive site and deserves the title "OneStop.” It is a site that begs you to surf around, gathering bits of information as you move from one link to another. However, be careful not to get trapped in a kind of rabbit hole, filled with so many twists and
turns, that you feel overwhelmed or confused. Try not to become so weighed down or frustrated that you give up your search. You may need to visit the site on more than one occasion, exploring bits at a time.
The Guide for Occupational Exploration (GOE)

The United States Department of Labor has divided all of the occupations in its enormous database into 12 groups, rated according to the primary interest they are likely to satisfy and published the results in the Guide for Occupational Exploration (GOE). It also provides detailed
information about aptitudes, skills, and job activities of various occupational groups.

The data in the GOE are organized into 12 interest areas and 66 worker trait groups. It helps answer these questions
+ What kind of work would you do?

+ What skills and aptitudes do you need for this kind of work?

* How do you know if you would like, or could learn, to do this kind of work?

* How can you prepare for and enter this kind of work?

* What else should you consider about these jobs?

Since its original p other p have

ped their own version of the GOE. These publications may vary in format and content, but the same worker trait group categories are used.

The GOE is a popular reference with career counselors but it can also be used without counselor assistance. As before, you need information about yourself before using this reference. You need to know the kind of work you would like to do and whether you are able to do such work.

Typically, you think about your interests and then select one or more related work groups to explore. Some subgroups and specific occupations are also provided. You then compare your present qualifications with those needed for the you are
Published References

If you visit a local bookstore, especially the big ones with larger inventories, you will find a section that features career information. In general, there seems to be an over abundance of books for writing resumes and interviewing for jobs, but there are also books on applying to universities,
taking exams, and entering the job market.

To a lesser degree, but at no cost to you, you will find some ig career in your local library. Another excellent place to find publications, especially the large reference books, are campus career resource centers. The most valuable information in printed

is general since up-to-date information is easier to find on the Internet.

Here are a few major and voluminous reference books that can be found in libraries and on the Internet:

The O1 Outlook t (OOH)

The OOH (external link 05) is published by the U.S. Department of Labor and revised every two years. It is based on a national survey and provides detailed information for about 250 occupations, which are representative of more than 85% of the jobs in the nation. The OOH is best
utilized as a reference. It is not meant to be read from cover to cover as you would a journal article or a popular non-fiction book. It won't read like a novel. However, because a standard format is used, it is easy to compare occupations.

The basic for each is

Nature of the work

Working conditions

Employment

Training, other qualifications, and advancement

Job outlook

Earnings

Related occupations

Sources of additional information
After you scan the information in the different areas, you will have a good idea of whether an occupation merits any more consideration. The book can also be useful for adding possible occupations to explore and eliminating those that are no longer appealing.

Now, go to the OOH http://www.bls.gov/ooh/_(external link 06) and look up your three possible jobs or occupations (Jobs 1, 2, and 3). Type in the jobs, where you are given a choice, and examine the nature of the work, the equipment that workers use, how closely they are supervised,
and how much variety is in their daily routines.

How do your jobs compare in terms of entry-level requirements? What are the projected outlooks? Are they fast or slow growing occupations? What about earnings?

We know, for example, that workers employed in medium and large firms with 100 or more employees usually enjoy better benefits than workers in small firms. Generally, it appears that medium and large firms provide more medical, dental, life insurance, disability insurance and
retirement benefits than do smaller companies.

The level of responsibility that goes with a job also affects earnings. Annual salaries for eight levels of engineers, in addition to five levels of engineering technicians and five more for drafters, are illustrated in charts and graphs in the OOH. These reflect different work levels, starting with
entry-level jobs and continuing up the career ladder to more complex and responsible supervisory positions. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that all people in one occupation earn more than those in another. We can say that the average is higher or that the middle range of earnings is
higher, but there is usually some overlap.
Managing the Internet
To save you time, we identified some respected and established websites that might be useful in your career search. These will appear later in the session. You may want to bookmark some of the sites and go back to them when you have time for more exploration.
First, here are some practical hints about using the Internet.

Once you link to a homepage, examine the headers and titles, and check out the site map to find more specific information. A keyword search at a site is often available. You might have to be a “mole” and dig down into a site to discover the data that you want. Some sites are like gold
mines, rich with information, while others provide little value or lead to dead ends.

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address that is used to access a resource on the Web. "Link rot” is a term used to describe the problem caused by the frequent changing of URLs. When you click on a hyperlink to be routed to another page, you might get an error message, or
“not available.” The page could say that the site has moved, is being reorganized, or perhaps is In our to you, we will try to avoid websites that rot away.

A webpage created by an individual (as opposed to someone creating a page for an institution, business, organization, or other entity) is called a personal page. It can contain valid and useful opinions and links to significant resources and facts. One attribute of the Web is the freedom it
has given everyone to put his or her ideas “out there.” It is worth noting, of course, that personal webpages frequently offer highly biased personal perspectives that may be of no use to you.

A blog (short for "web log") is another type of personal webpage. It serves as a publicly accessible personal journal (or log) for an individual. Typically updated daily or weekly, blogs reflect the personality of the author and the people who join in with their personal comments. The Internet
Public Library (external link 01) provides a comprehensive list of blogs that could complement a career search, such as those aimed at law and medicine.

If you already are an experienced web surfer, these hints might not be new information to you. However, since this is an online course with hyperlinks, it is important for you to be familiar with websites, their potential value, and their limitations. Our purpose here is to highlight how the
Internet can be used in a career search and to offer some practical suggestions about gathering career information.

Searching the Web
It's time to search the Web by going online to the Internet. You can use a search engine, such as Google (external link 02) or Bing (external link 03). You can begin by typing in the title of one of your jobs or occupations and see what turns up.

For instance, if you search for the word “accountant” you will see a list of the first 10 webpages out of more than 77 million where such a word appears. Hmmmmm? You might scroll down and scan the initial listings to see if there are any interesting leads. Almost always there are some
citations that provide general descriptions or definitions, as well as a few facts about the occupation or profession. But, the long list can be daunting, as well as repetitive, and the cost in terms of the time it would take to plow through such a listing is prohibitive.

A more expedient way is to enter directly the URL of a website, if you know it. Or, you can ly click on the hyp in Figure 7.1_(external link 04). Remember to bookmark or mark as favorites those sites where you want to return.

Kinds of Websites and Webpages

As you examine the list of career websites and webpages in Figure 7.1 (external link 04), you will see that they are organized into categories.

* Career SuperSites. These sites are so named because they were designed to be comprehensive and provide a “one stop” career shopping center. Once you are at the site, you will find numerous links to self-assessment tools, industry listings, job descriptions, and other topics.
+ Job Banks. These sites focus primarily on the availability of jobs in different regions and states, including salary ranges, and helping job seekers.

* Specific Populations. Some sites direct attention to particular career areas and issues, such as military careers, federal government jobs, Hispanic and bilingual professionals, and college students.

+ — International Careers. A few sites help job seekers find jobs abroad and give reports on trends in the countries and employing companies.

General Career Information. Some sites provide general basic online career and links to career sites.

The Internet

The Internet was first developed as a resilient computer network for the U. S. military. Its first major application was e-mail, which the way we i in the world. Even though it has only been a few decades since the Internet first became available to the general
public, it is now the major dominant source for gathering information, including searching for and learning about careers.

Many people use the terms “Internet” and "World Wide Web” (aka the Web) interchangeably, but in fact they are two different terms, not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two separate but related things.
The Internet is a massive network of networks; a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers and enabled devices together globally, forming a network in which any device can communicate with any other device as long as they are both connected to the Internet.
Information that travels over the Internet does so via a variety of languages known as protocols.

The World Wide Web (WWVV), or simply "the Web", is a way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the Internet. The Web uses HTTP protocol, which is one of the many languages spoken over the Internet, to
transmit data. Web services, which use HTTP to allow applications to communicate in order to exchange business logic, use the Web to share information.

The web also utilizes browsers to access Web documents called webpages that are linked to each other via hyperlinks. Web documents also contain graphics, sounds, text and videos. As a result, users can go online and browse documents that reside anywhere in the world; furthermore,
these documents can be linked to documents at other places in the world. The Web is the part of the Internet that provides such a rich source of career information.

Clearly, the Web is a vast system that needs navigation support. This is where Web browsers come into play. Browser software programs, such as Google’s Chrome, Apple's Safari, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, allow us to "surf the Internet” and to view and
interact with various types of Internet resources.

There are countless career-related sites to visit on the Web. You can research g and places of business, and gather data about cities and communities where jobs are located. You can get information about colleges and universities,
including schedules, academic requirements for majors, and p for entering 9 and graduate programs.
You can also find job listings. Employers have discovered that the Internet is a quick and cost-effective method to announce their employment needs. You can find about and the entry req for an There are some career

information sites that are very comprehensive, and you can spend hours reading the posts and exploring the links.

Unlike a library, the Internet never closes. It provides access to a fund of 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The sheer number of websites, however, can be overwhelming, and it is difficult to know the reliability and validity of the information provided. Some sites
are hard to navigate and this can be frustrating.

Pop-ups and other ads can also be annoying, but tolerable if the website has valuable After all, has to pay for the costs of developing and maintaining the websites. But, it is common sense to take note of who sponsored and developed the site you are viewing and
ask "What is their agenda?" “Are there any hidden costs?” “How far down this bunny trail do | want to travel?"

If you use a search engine, such as Google or Bing, and type in a job title or a career term, you will be presented with a long list of websites. Some will be relevant and others will not. You can scroll down the list, looking for titles that catch your eye and perk your interest. Random surfing
can be interesting, but it can also be like wandering aimlessly in a vast desert or forest. It is fascinating at first, and then it becomes bewildering and tiring.

Another approach is to look for and go to a specific website or webpage, such as the homepage of a college or university and then, using the pull down menus and links at the site, pursue your search. Still, there are many twists and turns at almost every website, and the Web can make
you feel trapped in a sticky mess that doesn’t make much sense.

Although searching the Internet is convenient and loaded with data, the search process can be confusing at times and discouraging. You may find that information is poorly organized, out of date, or misleading, depending on the skills and diligence of the site's developer. Consequently,
you may deem a web search as unproductive. There are ways to expedite the process and be more efficient.
Two Types of Searchers

There are two types of career information searchers 1) Haven't Got A Clue, and 2) Have An Occupation in Mind. The first group needs to answer a beginning and basic set of questions by visiting some places that can give them general ideas and directions. The second group can go
directly to places that are tied to their occupational goals, looking for more specific details. Some strategies will be useful to both groups, while there may be some other useful strategies that will be unique to each group.

If you are among the first group ("Haven't Got A Clue"), push yourself and select some occupations to research. Make a list of jobs that appeal to you. Pick a few that seem to match your aptitudes and skills, personality, and preferred work environment. It's okay if you are not absolutely
sure. Your choices can be sp or p gating them will help you learn the process of searching for career information and may set the stage for serendipity.

If you fall into the second category of searchers ("Have an Occupation in Mind"), then begin by defining the occupation and determining its main features. You can go directly to places where information is specific, perhaps interviewing a professional or doing some job shadowing. You can
always be on the lookout for serendipitous information that stimulates your thinking and encourages you to explore and discover more.

Getting Started Jobs 1, 2, and3

To begin your search, you need at least three possible jobs or occupations to explore. If you have a long list of potential occupations, group them according to industry or perhaps their primary job function (data, people, things, and ideas). Set priorities, perhaps ranking them in terms of
personal appeal and the kind of lifestyle you hope to have someday.

Make your third occupation a “fantasy job,” one that if all the conditions were right you could get excited about pursuing it. Or, the job could simply be intriguing and you would like to know more about it.
Once you have your three occupations in mind, it's time to start your search and gather information. As you begin, you should understand the different ways to conduct both focused and broad searches for information. Three helpful ways your might organize your search are by
* Occupation

+ Industry
* Career Family
Searching by occupations will provide the most specific information and will be especially useful if you already know the kind of work you want to do and some particular jobs you'd like to pursue. Information about industries gives more attention to the work settings where jobs are

performed (such as the television industry or the travel and tourism industry). This is useful if you know something about where you want to work but not necessarily the kind of work you want. Finally, a search by career families covers groups of related occupations. Information on career
families is most useful if you know something about the kind of work you want or the kinds of skills you want to use in your work but you are unsure of a specific job.

Let's look at a few places you might go and some things you might do in your searching.
g and Exp g Career Opp:
So, what do you want to do when you graduate from college?" You may have been asked this question more times than you want to count, or you could be hearing it for the first time. Regardless, it's probably time you try to answer the question.
Given these days and times, it may not be easy. However, you can begin with a search of possible jobs and occupations, even if tentative, and explore them to see what you can discover. The process can lead to something valuable.

This topic is an attempt to highlight ways that you can gather information about career opportunities. It is a guide for how to manage the search and explore process.

The Journey Begins with Searching

Certainly, an accurate self-assessment provides the foundation for a credible search. The more you know about yourself, the more you can trust your instincts and be more realistic when considering your options. It's important to appraise your skills and know which ones you can improve
upon and how they are related to immediate entry into a possible ion. Likewise, base makes sense because it can give you an edge when considering career choices, and an evaluation can reveal areas that need more attention and study. You have

ig yout
spent some time taking stock of yourself. You looked inward and considered how you relate and work wth others.

Now It's time to go beyond your profile and look at other factors that influence your decision-making. This may involve looking at your personal and family life and using as much information as you can to clarify your current circumstances. Because there is so much information available
that can be used in your search, you will want to employ good and time skills along the way.

Starting the Search Process

All of these comments suggest that there is a driving force that has produced some career goals. There is a desire to be to be to make a living, and to have a good lifestyle. While we can admire and appreciate the motivation and desire to make dreams come
true, there are some obstacles to be faced and some informed decisions to be made.

The Value of a Career Goal

The initial searching process starts by first identifying a desired career or occupational goal. Your goal can change, but for now, it can keep you focused and serve as a motivating factor. For instance, without at least a tentative career goal in mind, most college students tend to drift. The
courses they take have no special meaning, since only a few attend college for the love of learning and academic pursuit. So, why take courses that seem to serve no purpose? Is it just what everybody does so that they can say they are going to college? Is it just a way of passing time
until a clear career picture emerges? Is it a matter of going along with the crowd?

If you have a vision of a career goal, the courses are viewed as steps in the direction you want to go. As you listen to lectures, read books, and talk with others, you relate the topics and discussions to your eventual goal. When there is more meaning ascribed to a course, there is more
motivation to study. Students with this kind of focused mindset perform better in their classes and get higher grades than others who continue to coast aimlessly. This is not to say that you must determine a career goal now and not ever deviate from the path. You will have opportunities, if
appropriate, to change your mind and set out in new directions.

You might be asking, "But what if I'm not sure? There are so many things that | could do, and | want to make the best choice so | don't waste my time." Or, "I have a career goal, but | need to know more about it. | need to get a better picture of how | match up with the things that are done
and expected in that occupation.” In that case, you probably would benefit by more searching, exploring, and discovering things about your career goals and path.

The purpose of a career search is to identify or confirm options and possibilities. It enables you to pick courses, an academic major, internships, and entry-level jobs with more confidence. Even if you already have an occupation in mind, a career search can validate that you are on your
chosen track, and your path will seem clearer than before.

The Value of Career Information

Gathering information in advance about places you want to go can be useful. A travel brochure can acquaint you with a place that you have never been. Similarly, a novel can acquaint you with an experience that you have never had. They both can stimulate your imagination and create
personal meanings for you.

Career and occupational information is like that. It introduces you to possibilities and allows you to visualize opportunities. You can get a feel for something and try it out mentally before you invest a lot of time, energy, and money in pursuing a particular career path.

Getting to know careers and occupations is like shining a light into the dark; you are less likely to stumble. The path and choices will be more obvious. As new information and experiences shed light on your career interests and goals, you will feel reassured that you are doing the best that
you can to make calculated and rewarding choices.

Gathering career information can take place in your home with the help of the Internet. You can go to a Career Resource Center at your university or college campus. You can talk with experts, interview people in the field, and read publications. As this session continues, we will be taking a
closer look at these resources.

Two Types of Searchers

There are two types of career information searchers 1) Haven't Got A Clue, and 2) Have An Occupation in Mind. The first group needs to answer a beginning and basic set of questions by visiting some places that can give them general ideas and directions. The second group can go
directly to places that are tied to their occupational goals, looking for more specific details. Some strategies will be useful to both groups, while there may be some other useful strategies that will be unique to each group.
